343. Extract 20 seconds without re-encoding:
```bash
ffmpeg -ss 00:01:30.000 -i YOUR_VIDEO.mp4 -t 00:00:20.000 -c copy YOUR_EXTRACTED_VIDEO.mp4
```
344. Tuning options in ffmpeg:
```
film ‚Äì use for high quality movie content;
animation ‚Äì good for cartoons;
grain ‚Äì preserves the grain structure in old, grainy film material;stillimage ‚Äì good for slideshow-like content;
fastdecode ‚Äì allows faster decoding by disabling certain filters;
zerolatency ‚Äì good for fast encoding and low-latency streaming;
psnr ‚Äì only used for codec development;
ssim ‚Äì only used for codec development;
Example: 
ffmpeg -i your_video.mov -c:v h264 -crf 23 -tune film your_output.mp4
```
345. You can use 2 pass encoding for targeting a specific output file size, but not care so much about output quality from frame to frame.
346. `For an output that is roughly 'visually lossless' but not technically and waaaay less file size, just use -crf 17 or 18`.
347. You can also constrain the maximum bitrate (useful for streaming!)
```
ffmpet -i input.mp4 -c:v h264 -crf 23 -maxrate 1M -bufsize 2M output.mp4
```
348. Recommend adding a `faststart` flag to your video so that it begins playing faster (recommended by YouTube).
```
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v h264 -crf 23 -maxrate 1M -bufsize 2M -movflags +faststart output.mp4
```
349. If you want to produce 1080p and above, h265 offers great savings in bitrates/file size (ntoe: needs to be built with `--enable-gpl --enable-libx265`).
```
ffmpeg -i input -c:v libx265 -crf 28 -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.mp4
```
350. h266 video codec: 
- with h265, to transmite a 90min UHD file, it needs about 10 gigabytes of data
- with h266, you need only about 5 gigabytes.
Can deal with 4k/8k and 360 degree video!

351. VP8 videos: Supposed to be web standard.
352. OF COURSE Google made vp9 in direct competition of h265, you need `libvpx-vp9`.
353. OH LORD Youtube recommends it's own [ffmpeg settings!!!](https://developers.google.com/media/vp9/settings/vod)
354. AV1 video - SD and HD under bandwidth constrained networks.
355. Netflix codedc is SVT-AV1 and they [have blog posts explaining it](https://netflixtechblog.com/svt-av1-an-open-source-av1-encoder-and-decoder-ad295d9b5ca2), as well as github repos!
356. AV1AN exists becuase AV1/VP9/VP8 are not easily multithreaded ... üòï 
357. RTMP is for "Real time Messaging Protocol" and is the de facto standard for all live videos in FB, Insta, YT, Twitch, Twitter, Periscope etc. Streaming pre recorded video to live can be done in at least 2 ways:
- take input file "as is" and convert in real time to FLV (and stream it live via:)
```
-f flv rtmp://a.rtmp.youtube.com/live2/[YOUR_STREAM_KEY]
#: this will instruct FFMPEG to output everything into the required FLV format to the YouTube RTMP server
```

358. PRE PROCESS FILES IN BATCH: pg 113/122
```
for i in *.mov; do ffmpeg -i "$i" -c:v libx264 -profile:v high -level:v 4.1 -preset veryfast -b:v 3000k -maxrate 3000k -bufsize 6000k -pix_fmt yuv420p -r 25 -g 50 -keyint_min 50 -sc_threshold 0 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -ac 2 -ar 44100 "${i%.*}.mp4"; done
```
"The above example script will pre-process every .movfile contained in the directory, in line with the YouTube's requirements for streaming a Full-HD 1080p at 25FPS."

340. `tmux` can be used to keep persistent sessions on `ssh`, so `mosh` is not necessarily needed.
The way to do this (Credit to Danny Sharp) is do the ssh inside a tmux session and then
`tmux ls` to see which sessions you have made and then `tmux attach-session -t 3` to connect to session 3.
This is a smart way of checking in on long running compute jobs.
341. From `FFMPEG Zero to Hero`:
```
BITRATE: Bitrate or data rate is the amount of data per
second in the encoded video file, usually expressed in kilobits per second (kbps)
or megabits per second (Mbps).  The bitrate measurement is also applied to audio files.
An Mp3 file, for example, can reach a maximum bitrate of 320 kilobit per second,
while a standard CD (non-compressed) audio track can have up to 1.411 kilobit per 
second. A typical compressed h264 video in Full-HD has a bitrate 
in the range of 3.000 - 6.000 kbps, while a 4k video can reach
a bitrate value up to 51.000 kbps.  A non-compressed video format,
such as the Apple ProRes format in 4K resolution, can reach a bitrate of 253.900 kbps and higher. 
```
342. FFMPEG can read and write to basically any format under the sun, and has been designed by the MPEG:
`Moving Pictures Expert Group`.

325. Federico Simonetta [asks](https://julialang.slack.com/archives/C67910KEH/p1626281444356200):
```
Dummy question: if I have T=Vector{Int32}, I can get the inner type using eltype. How can I get the outer type? (i.e. Vector so that I can create a new Vector but using a different inner type?)
```
Which I think Erik Schnetter wanted since a [long time ago.]
There's now a Base method [for this]():
```julia
Base.typename(T).wrapper # credit to Jakob Nissen
```
But name is being bikeshed currently.

If you want to use `CustomType{Matrix{Float32}}`, Rackauckas says that 
```julia
Base.@pure __parameterless_type(T) = Base.typename(T).wrapper
```
can be used, instead of `SciMLBase.parameterless_type(T)`.

Matt Bauman is convinced it's a footgun, and we should just stick to using `similar(x, AnotherType)` instead.

326. Conor Hoekstra nerdsniped me into learning some APL - here's my attempt for printing 'Even' or 'Odd' depending on a summation

323. [Loop invariants](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~ylzhang/csc236/files/lec08-loop-invariant.pdf) have 3 steps:
- you have a loop with `E` a loop guard and body `S`
```
while E:
    S
```
- You then initialize the loop, see that the LI condition holds with the guard `E` and the precondition.
- You then prove that if the Loop Invariant condition holds before the i-th iteration of the loop, it holds in the i+1-th iteration of the loop
- At the end, you use the negation of `E` and the LI to affirm something useful about the program (most likely, the post condition).
  * Merge Sort example:
    - Hardest part is thinking of the LI in the first place.
    - "For arrays L and I, L[i] and R[j] hold the smallest elements not in S (target vector)"

302. [Julia macros for beginners](https://jkrumbiegel.com/pages/2021-06-07-macros-for-beginners/): `esc` means "treat this variable like a variable the user has written themselves." AKA interpolating within the macro only gives you variables local to the macro's module, escaping treats it as a user variable.
- Before writing a macro for an expression, try to understand it first with `Meta.@dump`.
- A good check for correct escaping is passing in local variables.
```julia
julia> module m
           export fill
           macro fill(exp, sizes...)
               iterator_expressions = map(sizes) do s
                   Expr(
                       :(=),
                       :_,
                       quote 1:$(esc(s)) end

303. `Dr. Takafumi Arakaki` has some good recommendations on globals - mark them inside functions!
```julia
julia> global a = 1;

julia> good() = global a += 1;

julia> bad() = a += 1;

julia> good()
2

julia> bad()
ERROR: UndefVarError: a not defined
```
304. Try to also avoid this idiom:
```julia
function consumer()
    id = threadid()
    report = 0
    println("I'm consumer $(threadid())")
    ...
```
Instead try doing
```julia
for id in 1:numProducers
    @spawn producer(id)
end
```
He also recommends that "while debugging, you'd probably wan tto show the error from producers and consumers like this"
```julia
@spawn try
    producer()
catch err
    @error "Unexpected error from a producer" exception = (err, catch_backtrace())
    rethrow()
end
```
305. Neat trick - don't use `while true` loops in the beginning üòÖ . Use `for _ in 1:10_000` to check if the threads are even alive.


### 20/06/2021

281. I read [Lamports Logical Clocks](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/time-clocks.pdf) paper today. I learned a couple of things.
- To totally order all events in a distributed system, you only need each process to keep a counter of its own events, and send events with its own timestamp. If you get a timestamp equal or higher than your own, then you bump your up to that amount.
- However, these total orderings can be "unsynched" from the real world - if you include some small perturbations in your timestamps, you can, within bounded time (and quite fast) always synchronize your system.
282. Now reading [Paxos Paper](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/paxos-simple.pdf).
- To coordinate proposals of a value, it's good to keep a threshold counter and reject proposals which are inferior to that.
- [Fischer, Lynch, and Patterson]() implies that " a reliable algoritm for eledcting a proposer must use either randomness or real time -- for example, by using timeouts."
283. `CHOOSE` is nondeterministic - if it chose 38 today, it will choose that again next week. You never need to write `x' = CHOOSE i \in 1..9 : TRUE`, just use `x' \in 1..99`. Use `CHOOSE` only when there's exactly 1 `v` in `S` satisfying formula `P`, like in the definition of `Maximum(s)`
```tla
Maximum(S) == IF S = {} THEN -1
              ELSE CHOOSE x \in S : \A m \in S : x \geq m
```
284. The `ASSUME` statement is made for assumptions about the constants
285. `SUBSET Acceptor` == `PowerSetOf(Acceptor)`.
286. `EXCEPT` can be chained!
```tla
       /\ aState' = [aState EXCEPT ![m.ins][acc].mbal = m.bal,
                                   ![m.ins][acc].bal  = m.bal,
                                   ![m.ins][acc].val  = m.val]
```
287. This is also legit:
```tla
Phase1b(acc) ==  
  \E m \in msgs : 
    /\ m.type = "phase1a"
    /\ aState[m.ins][acc].mbal < m.bal
    /\ aState' = [aState EXCEPT ![m.ins][acc].mbal = m.bal]
    /\ Send([type |-> "phase1b", 
             ins  |-> m.ins, 
             mbal |-> m.bal, 
             bal  |-> aState[m.ins][acc].bal, 
             val  |-> aState[m.ins][acc].val,
             acc  |-> acc])
    /\ UNCHANGED rmState

```
288. Elements of a `Symmetry Set` may not appear in a `CHOOSE`.
289. `ASSUME` must be a constant formula.
290. Specs hold as undefined all values of all variables not used at all times. It's best not to think of specs as programs which describe the correct behaviour of the system. The describe a universe in which the system and its environment are behaving correctly.   
291. Steps that leave are variable values unchanged are called `stuttering steps`. Including stuttering steps helps us say what a system *may* do, but now we want to specify what a system *must* do.
292. A finite sequence is another name for `tuple`.
292. [Alternating Bit](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/video/ABSpec.tla) protocol: Let's say you have users A and B. If A sends to B 4 strings, how can B detect if A sent repeated strings multiple times? There is no way to tell apart `Fred, Mary, Mary, Ted, Ted, Ted, Ann` from `Fred, Mary, Ted, Ann`. You could timestamp it, but let's not. It's easiest to just append a bit that flips after every message. Appending a bit can be done with
```tla
TypeOK == /\ Data \X {0, 1} \* where \X is the cartesian product
```
293. To talk about `may/must`, we will talk about liveness and Safety properties.
- `Safety Formula`: Asserts what may happen. Any behavior that violates it does so at some point. Nothing past that point makes nay difference.
- `üî∑ Liveness / eventually Formula`: Asserts only what must happen. A behavior can *not* violate it at any point. Only liveness property sequential programs must satisfy is `üî∑Terminated`
- Weak fairness of Action A: if A ever remains continuously enabled, then A step must eventually occur. Equivalent - A cannot remain enabled forever without another A step occurring. It's written as `WF_vars(A)`
  - A spec with liveness is writeen as `Init [][Next]_vars /\ Fairness`
  - Have TLC check the liveness property by clicking on the `Properties` part of the toolbox and then `\A v \in Data \X {0,1} : (AVar = v) ~> (BVar = v)`.
294. Now on to the full [AB Protocol](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/video/AB.tla)
295. `Strong Fairness` of action A asserts of a behavior: 
    - If A is ever `repeatedly enabled`, then an A step must eventually occur.
    - Equivalently: A cannot be repeatedly enabled forever without another A step occurring.
    - Weak fairness gives you the possibility of your enabling condition being flip-flopped forever. Strong fairness guarantees if you are enabled repeatedly, A must occurr.
296. What good is liveness? What is the good in knowing that something eventually happens in 10^6 years? This is good if there's no hard real time requirements.
297. Recursive declarations must be prepended with `RECURSIVE`
```tla
RECURSIVE RemoveX(_)

298. The Temporal Substitution law: can't do the basic maths trick have to had the üî≤ 
```tla
THEOREM üî≤ (v = e) => (f = (f WITH v <- e))

299. When in AB2, we add the possibility for messages to be corrupted. If that happens, we will need to compare messages to a potential "Bad" string, and TLC will yell at formulas like `"Bad" = 0`. Instead, we can call the constant `Bad` a model value.
300. When trying to specify the liveness of the spec, it's good to try and attach metadata for what actually happened, but don't append `TRUE/FALSE` to your messages - separate another Sequence as `<<TRUE,FALSE,TRUE...>>` to keep track of the *real* and *imaginary* parts of the spec.
301. Refinement mappings help make implementations easier.

267. In TLA+, every value is a set: 42 is a set, "abc" is a set.
268. This represents 
```tla
TCTypeOK ==
    rmState \in [RM -> {"working", "prepared", "committeed", "aborted"}]
TCInit == rmState = [r \in RM |-> "working"] (* this means the array with index set RM such that every element rm of RM is mapped to "working"*)
```
269. Terminology
| Programming | Math|
|---|---|
| array | function |
|index set | domain |
|f[e] | f(e) |
270. Remember notation for updating a record: 
```tla
Prepare(r) == /\ rmState[r] = "working"
              /\ rmState' = [rmState EXCEPT ![r] = "prepared"]

Decide(r)  == \/ /\ rmState[r] = "prepared"
                 /\ canCommit
                 /\ rmState' = [rmState EXCEPT ![r] = "committed"]
              \/ /\ rmState[r] \in {"working", "prepared"}
                 /\ notCommitted
                 /\ rmState' = [rmState EXCEPT ![r] = "aborted"]
```
271. Ah! Draw the state machine and then figure out the actions that transition to each state!
272. If you see the Coverage of actions and some of the actions were never taken `Count == 0`, it usually means there's an error in the spec.
273. End of line `\* comment syntax`
274. This record is actually a function, whose domain is `{"prof", "name"} such that f["prof"] = "Fred" and f["num"] = 42`. `f.prof === f["prof"]`
```tla
[prof |-> "Fred", num |-> 42]
```
275. Abbreviate `[f EXCEPT !["prof"] = "Red"` as `[f EXCEPT !.prof = "Red"}]`
276. `UNCHANGED <<rmState, tmSTate, msgs>>` is an ordered triple. It's equivalent to 
```tla
... /\ rmState' = rmState
    /\ tmState' = tmState
    /\ msgs' = msgs
```
277. Conditions which have no primes' are calle *enabling conditions*, and  in an Action Formula should go at the beginning, like so.
```tla
TMRcvPrepared(r) == /\ tmState = "init"
                    /\ [type |-> "Prepared", rm |-> r] \in msgs
```
278. Update the CommunityModules.jar... or else get hit by a bug..
279. `Symmetry sets`: if "r1"‚Üî "r3" in all states of behavior `b` allowed by `TwoPhase` produces a behaviour `b\_{1,3}` allowed by `TwoPhase`, TLC does not have to check `b\_{1,3}` if it has checked `b`. Becuase `RM = {"r1", "r2", "r3"}`, We say that RM is a `symmetry set` of `TwoPhase`. To exploit this, replace
```tla 
RM <- {"r1", "r2", "r3"}
```
with 
```tla
RM <- {r1, r2, r3}
```
select `Set of model values/Symmetry Set` just below it.
280. So it turns out that TwoPhase Commit can break if the TM fails. If you try to "just" engineer it with a second TM, they can cannibalize messages if TM1 pauses and TM2 takes over and sends an abort signal.



### 18/06/2021

256. A `behaviour` of a system is a sequence of states. A `state machine` is described by all its possible initial states and a next state relation. A `state` is an assignment of values to variables. The part of the program that controls what action is executed next is called the `control state`.
257. A new TLA+ spec...
```tla
------------------------------- MODULE simple -------------------------------
EXTENDS Integers
VARIABLES pc, i


Init == i = 0 /\ pc = "start"

Pick == \/ /\ pc = "start"
           /\ i' \in 0..1000
           /\ pc' = "middle"
         
Add1 == \/ /\ pc = "middle"
           /\ i' = i + 1
           /\ pc' = "done"

Next == Pick \/ Add1

261. This formula `FillSmall == small' = 3` is WRONG. It's true for some steps and false for others. It is NOT an assignment. The `big` must remain unchanged! If you don't you are coding, if you do keep it same, you are doing math. eg:
```tla
FillSmall == /\ small' = 3
             /\ big' = big
```
262. Remember you can add `TypeOK` as an invariant and `big # 4` too!
263. `big + small =< 5` , not `big + small <= 5` üôÅ 
264. Equality is commutative! `0 = small === small' = 0`
265. Use a ' expression only in `v' = ...` and `v' \in ...`

### 11/06/2021

196. `MXCSR`: Multimedia eXtension Control and Store Registers - can be accessed with `vldmxcsr, vstmxcsr`
197.  The amazing `Jubilee` shares another nugget:
> So like... the problem with those is that access to the MXCSR bit field actually can break LLVM compilation assumptions.
> it's literally UB.
> To touch it. At all.
> Now, it so happens that LLVM may not break your code if you actually do it, and LLVM is slowly growing the capability to handle altering MXCSR in a principled manner, but anyone touching it is doing so at their own risk, aware that it's UB.
198. When going form AVX to SSE instructions, there may be a performacne penalty due to keeping the upper 128 bits of YMM registers intact - use `vzeroupper` before that to avoid all perf penalties. Also, AVX allows unaligned accesses with a perf cost, but keeping alignment will increase perf.
199. MASM calling convention: pass first 4 float args in xmm0:3.
200. Leaf functions in assembly don't need a prolog or epilog, non-leaf functions *must*: save and restore volatile registers, initialize stack frame pointer, allocate local storage space on the stack, call other functions.
201. In C++, you can align xmm values with
```cpp
struct XmmVal {
public:
    union {
        int8_t m_I8[16];
        int16_t m_I16[8];
        //...
        float m_F32[4];
        double m_F64[2];
    }
}
void AvxPackedMathF64 {
    alignas(16) XmmVal a;
    alignas(16) XmmVal b;
    alignas(16) XmmVal c[8];
}
```
202. To get those xmm's into vector registers:
```asm
; Load packed SPFP values
    vmovaps xmm0, xmmword ptr [rcx] ;xmm0 = a
    vmovaps xmm1, xmmword ptr [rdx] ;xmm1 = b
```
So, note you load the entire `xmm` register with `xmmword ptr [foo]`.
203. Super cool trick to check 16 byte alignment (no perf penalty)
```asm
test rcx, ofh ; jump if x not aligned to 16 byte boundary
jnz Done
```
204. Macros avoid overehad of a function call.
205. Want to transpose a matrix? Use a bunch of `vunpcklps`, `vunpckhps`, `vmovlhps`, `vmovhlps`.


### 10/06/2021

175. Assembly! 
*    rax - temporary register; when we call a syscal, rax must contain syscall number
*    rdi - used to pass 1st argument to functions
*    rsi - ptr  to pass 2nd argument to functions
*    rdx - used to pass 3rd argument to functions
This mirrors this syscall in C:
```c
size_t sys_write(unsigned int fd, const char* buf, size_t count);
```
* `fd` - file descriptor, 0,1,2 for stin, stdout, and stderr respectviely
* `buf` - points to char array, can store content from file pointed at by fd
* `count` - specifies number of bytes to be written from the file into the char array

176. Little-endian - smallest byte as smallest address. Derp.
177. `data, bss, text` - initialized consts/dadta, non initialized vars, code section in asm.
178. registers: rax:rdx, bp sp si di, r8:r15
179. There's several types of initialzied data `db` (declare bytes), `dw` (declare words), etc.
There's also `RESB, RESW` as reserved bytes, reserved words, etc. `INCBIN` is for external binary files, `EQU` for defining constants:
```asm
one equ 1
```
Exercise: try to translate the following C code into asm:
```c
if (rax != 50) {
    exit();
} else {
    right();
}
```
Attempt:
```asm
    cmp rax, 50
    jne .exit
    jmp .right ; HOT DAMN FIRST TRY YO
```
180. Only 6 args can be pass via registers, the rest are passed on the stack:
*    rdi - first argument
*    rsi - second argument
*    rdx - third argument
*    rcx - fourth argument
*    r8 - fifth argument
*    r9 - sixth
So if you have 
```c
int foo(int a1, int a2, int a3, int a4, int a5, int a6, int a7)
{
    return (a1 + a2 - a3 - a4 + a5 - a6) * a7;
}
```
The first six are pass in the registers, and the 7th arg you have to pop from the stack: `push arg/ pop arg`.
In MASM, you get 4 registers for calling convention and the rest are in 8 byte incremetns from the RSP.
ALSO: After you are finished being called, you have to restor registers `rbp, rbx, r12:r15`

181. You can write nicer headers
```asm
section .data
		SYS_WRITE equ 1
		STD_IN    equ 1
		SYS_EXIT  equ 60
		EXIT_CODE equ 0
    
		NEW_LINE   db 0xa
		WRONG_ARGC db "Must be two command line argument", 0xa
```
182. `$, $$` return the position in memory of string where `$` is defined, and position in memory of current section start, resp.
183. Why the instruction `mov rdi, $ + 15`? You need to use the `objdump` util, and look at the line after `calculateStrLength`
```
objdump -D reverse

reverse:     file format elf64-x86-64

Disassembly of section .text:

00000000004000b0 <_start>:
  4000b0:	48 be 41 01 60 00 00 	movabs $0x600141,%rsi
  4000b7:	00 00 00
  4000ba:	48 31 c9             	xor    %rcx,%rcx
  4000bd:	fc                   	cld

  4000d0:	48 31 ff             	xor    %rdi,%rdi
  4000d3:	eb 0e                	jmp    4000e3 <reverseStr>
```
184. To checkif a string is set:
```asm
    test rax, rax               ; check if name is provided 
    jne .copy_name
```

185. Assembly has macros! These are single line
```asm
%define argc rsp + 8
%define cliArg1 rsp + 24
```
These are multi line
```asm
%macro bootstrap 1          ; %macro name number_of_params
          push ebp
          mov ebp,esp
%endmacro
```
186. Don't forget the `.period` when you `call .function`, AND in the function section titles:
```asm
.returnTrue
    mov eax, 1
    ret
```
187. THERE'S STRUCTS in ASSEMBLY?
```asm
struc person
   name: resb 10
   age:  resb 1
endstruc
; and then
section .data
    p: istruc person
      at name db "name"
      at age  db 25
    iend

section .text
_start:
    mov rax, [p + person.name]
```
187. [Call C from assembly, assembly from C](https://0xax.github.io/asm_7/)
188. x86 has 8 registers for floats, they are 10 bytes each, labeled from ST0:ST7
- `fld dword [x] ` pushes x to this stack.
- `fldpi` loads pi, lol.
```asm
extern printResult

section .data
		radius    dq  1.7
		result    dq  0

		SYS_EXIT  equ 60
		EXIT_CODE equ 0

global _start
section .text

_start:
		fld qword [radius]
		fld qword [radius]
		fmul

		fldpi
		fmul
		fstp qword [result]

		mov rax, 0
		movq xmm0, [result]
		call printResult

		mov rax, SYS_EXIT
		mov rdi, EXIT_CODE
		syscall
```
You have data in `radius` and `result`. `fld qword [radius]` stores radius in ST0, and again in ST1. `fmul` then multiplies both and puts it in ST0. Load pi with `fldpi`, multiply, and store that result with `fstp qword [result]`. C calling convention: pass floats to system through `xmm` registers, so you have to declare how many you are using - do that with `mov rax, 0`, `movq xmm0, [result]`, `call printResult`, then exit.
189. [GREAT ASSEMBLY TUTORIAL](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/nasmtutorial/)
190. `shl` must use register `cl` to make the shifts.
191. `sar` shift arithmetic right because it carries over the bit, like in arithmetic, ha.
192. `cdq` -> "convert dobule word to quadword": Dividend in EAX must be sign extended to 64bits.
193. Do integer conversions with `movsx`, "move integer with sign extension" and `movzxd` "move unsigned integer with sign extension double word"
194. `@F` is a forward jump, `@B` backwards jump

166. [Parallel Computing course](https://wgtm21.netlify.app/parallel_julia/) by WestGrid Canada + HPC.
167. [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started.html) sounds like a decent package manager for Cpp.
169. LLVM Tips and tricks: 
    - Use Ninja and tons of flags to speedup compilation: don't build all backends, use the new pass manager, only target host architecture, optimized tablegen, release with debug info,
    -
170.[oh shit git](https://ohshitgit.com/) seems neat!
171. To see what is actually printed after macro replacements, use `clang -E foo.c`.
172. `LLVM Bugpoint` does case test reduction
173. You can unit test the optimizer o.0
```llvm
; RUN: opt < %s -constprop -S | FileCheck %s
define i32 @test() {
  %A = add i32 4, 5
  ret i32 %A
  ; CHECK: @test()
  ; CHECK: ret i32 9
}
```

### 08/06/2021

164. Lord help me my `Learn LLVM 12` book is here and I'm learning C++ to be an uber Julia hacker. Taking the `C++ Beyond the Basics ` course by Kate Gregory I learned
- `inst const zero = 0` tells the comp `zero` can't change.
- `int taxes(int const total)` tells the copmiler `total` can't change within the lifetime of this function
- `int GetName() const;` const modify the class its in.
- `inst const ci = 3` and `const int ci = 3` are both valid, but prefer `const` after the thing that can't change.
- `[=](){}` is a lambda func that copys everything by value, `[&]` by ref, but copies smartly only the things you used.
```cpp
vector nums {1,2,3,45};
auto isOdd = [](int candidates){candidates % 2 != 0;};
int odds = std::count_if(begin(nums), end(nums), isOdd);
// std algorithms have all the goodies that apply to iterators like
//any_of, all_of, etc
```
- to generate collections, instead of a for loop, try
```cpp
int i = 0;
std::generate_n(std::back_inserter(v), 5, [&]() { return i++; });
```

- to accumulate the elements,
```cpp
int total = 0
total = std::accumulate(begin(v), end(v), 0);
```
- to count elements
```cpp
int count3 = std::count(begin(v), end(v), 3);
```
- to remove elements == 3,
```cpp
auto v4 = v;
auto endv4 = std::remove_if(begin(v4), end(v4), [](int elem) {return (elem == 3)}; );
v4.erase(endv4, end(v4)); // or even v4.erase(std::remove_if(...));
```
- if you use functional style, you can replace `vector<int> v -> list<int> v`, (you don't have [] in lists)
- counting all of something
```cpp
bool allpositive = std::all_of(begin(v4), end(v4), [](int elem) { return elem >= 0; });
```
- ermahgerd `sort(v4)` finally exists in g++20!!!!
- `g++ -std=c++20 numbers.cpp` to get things to work...
- `auto letter = find(begin(v4), end(v4), 'a');`
- try/catch: put most specific errors first, use `std::invalid_argument("foo")`, `catch (exception& e) { cout << e.what(); }`
- do this, not `auto x = new X(Stuff); delete x`
```cpp
try {
    auto x = make_unique<X>(Stuff);
    // risky stuff
}
```
- `constexpr` is evaluated at compile time
- range for statements:
```cpp
for (auto i : v)
for (auto x : {10, 20, 30})
for (auto& x : v) //refers, doesn't modify
```
- `while (p)`, works until pointer is null - UGH
- `x.name` accesses the struct `x` field `name` through reference and `x->name` trough the pointer. Huh?
- `static_assert` exists
- virtual syntax is `= 0`, means `may be redefined later in a class derived from this one`.
```cpp
class Container {
    public:
    virtual double& operator[](int) = 0;//pure virtual function
    virtual int size() const = 0;//const member function (¬ß4.2.1)
    virtual  ÃÉContainer() {} //destructor (¬ß4.2.2)};
}
```
- `:public` can be read as "is a subtype of"
- Essential operations
```cpp
class X {
    public:
        X(Sometype);                    //ordinar y constructor: create an object
        X();                            //default constructor
        X(const X&);                    //copy constr uctor
        X(X&&);                         //move constr uctor
        X& operator=(const X&);         //copy assignment: clean up target and copy
        X& operator=(X&&);              //move assignment: clean up target and move
        ÃÉX();                            //destr uctor: clean up
        //...
        //Y(const) //
};
```
pg 53 of Tour of Cpp really says talks about move semantics
* soruce of an assignment
* an object initializer
* as a func arg
* as a func return value
* as an exception
- drop objects at end of scopes == RAII
- move/copy and be suppresed with `Shape& operator=(Shape&&) = delete;` + friends on pg 55
- TEMPLATES!
```cpp
template <typename T>
class Vector {
private:
    T* elem;
    int sz;
public:
    explicit Vector(int s);    //constructor, establish invariant, acquire resources
    ~Vector() {delete[] elem;} //destructor, release resources
    //copy+move ops
    T* operator[](int n);
    const T& operator[](int i) const;
    int size() const {return sz;}
}
```
This is also possible:
```cpp
template <typename T, int N>
struct Buffer {
    using value_type = T;
    constexpr int size() { return N: }
//...
}
```
- You can create function objects/closures! `it(n)` pg 64
- add `override` after virtual ops, type your enmus, default value inits structs `int value = 5`, 


165. Rust tips: Finally found a decent SIMD tutorial for Rust! I learned that ISCP is a C SIMD dialect to get super optimal performance. Instead of their Hello world, we can try doing something like this:
```rust
pub fn dotp(x: &[f32], y: &[f32], z: &mut [f32]) {
    let n = 1024; // or let n = x.len();
    let (x, y, z) = (&x[..n], &y[..n], &mut z[..n]);
    for i in 0..n {
        z[i] = x[i].mul_add(y[i], z[i]);
    }
}
```
that exploits the `x.len()` to pass that info to LLVM for more optims.
### 05/06/2021

162. [Introduction to Undefined Behaviour](https://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know.html) and a blog post by [John Regehr](https://blog.regehr.org/archives/213) - time to grok some of this nonsense.
- `for(int i = 0; i <= N; i++) {...}` if overflow is UB, then the compiler can assume the loop stops in at most `N+1` iterations (because if  `N == INT_MAX`, the loop may be infinite!)
- Oh damn, the first post is by Chris Lattner, author of LLVM o.0

163. `@agustinc3301` kindly helped me setup Cloudflare analytics on my Franklin.jl blog. It's free and quick! You verify your account after signing up and then add the link to your Franklin footer in `_layout/foot.html` and `page_foot.html` (I think.). That did it! Now I can see redditors accessing the `Julia To Rust` post  üîé 


### 04/06/2021
159. `Jubilee` recommends capturing mutation to smaller scopes in Rust instead of the C-ish idiom of mutation everywhere:
```rust
    let mut i = 0;
    while i < N {
        let d2s = f64x2::from_array([
            (r[i] * r[i]).horizontal_sum(),
            (r[i + 1] * r[i + 1]).horizontal_sum(),
        ]);
        let dmags = f64x2::splat(dt) / (d2s * d2s.sqrt());
        mag[i] = dmags[0];
        mag[i + 1] = dmags[1];
        i += 2;
    }
```
Can be converted to 
```rust
    for i in (0..N).step_by(2) {
        let d2s = f64x2::from_array([
            (r[i] * r[i]).horizontal_sum(),
            (r[i + 1] * r[i + 1]).horizontal_sum(),
        ]);
        let dmags = f64x2::splat(dt) / (d2s * d2s.sqrt());
        mag[i] = dmags[0];
        mag[i + 1] = dmags[1];
    }
```
160. To run `cargo watch` on a non-standard file, use ` cargo watch -c -x "run --examples dot_product"`. Credit to `Lokathor`.
161. Finally got the code working for the `dot_product.rs`! in the end, it wasn't so scary:
```rust
#![feature(array_chunks)] // gotta have this
fn dot(a: &[f32], b: &[f32]) -> f32 {
    a.array_chunks::<4>() // el paso de la muerte
    .map(|&a| f32x::from_array(a))
    .zip(b.array_chunks::<4>().map(|&b| f32x4::from_array(b))) // so aside form some ugly conversions all is peachy
    .map(|(a,b)| (a * b).horizontal_sum())
    .sum()
}
```


### 03/06/2021

155. Rust syntax for updating structs with `..other_struct` is very neat.
156. `if let Some(word) = ... {}`
157. `while let Some(Some(word)) = ... {}`
158. `cargo watch -c` is very useful for seeing how you're code is going! Credit to `Lokathor` for the `-c` flag.

### 31/05/2021
152. `make -C debug` julia builds are much faster to build because you are not optimizing anymore - hat tip to Jameson Nash for that.
153. LLVM trap is what calls unreachable - tells the runtime that this should never happen. Basically checking that codegen didn't screw up.
154. `git add -u` 

### 30/05/2021
151. Finally got the hang of the Rust `dbg!` macro:
```rust
let a = 2;
let b = dbg!(a * 2) + 1;
//      ^-- prints: [src/main.rs:2] a * 2 = 4
assert_eq!(b, 5);
```
Very useful for the competitive problems debugging!

### 27/05/2021

145. Finally got around to the `nucleotide` in Rust exercism. My solution was a bit C-ish, this is neater: (Credits to `azymohliad`, but with no `Err`)
```rust
fn count(c:char, dna: &str) -> usize {
    dna.chars().filter(|&x| x == c).count()
}

fn nucleotide_counts(dna: &str) -> HashMap<char, usize> {
    "ACGT".chars().map(|c| (c, count(c, dna))).collect()
}
```

Another clever initialization trick by `jtmueller`:
```rust
let mut counts: HashMap<char, usize> = ['A', 'C', 'T', 'G'].iter().map(|n| (*n, 0)).collect();
```
Probs worth using `HashMap::with_capacity(4)` since I know there's only `ACTG` as keys.

147. Rust: `use enum::*;`, and then you don't need to `enum::foo` all over your match arms!

148. I learned about the `slice.windows(2)` function in the `sublist` exercise, [link here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.windows)
```rust
let slice = ['r', 'u', 's', 't'];
let mut iter = slice.windows(2);
assert_eq!(iter.next().unwrap(), &['r', 'u']);
assert_eq!(iter.next().unwrap(), &['u', 's']);
assert_eq!(iter.next().unwrap(), &['s', 't']);
assert!(iter.next().is_none());
```

149. Difference between `show` and `print`: `print` uses quotes around the string, `show` doesn't, and this 

150. Rust: `map.entry(letter).or_insert(0)) += 1`

### 26/05/2021

144. FINALLY GOT THE ASSEMBLY HELLO WORLD TO WORK!
- I had to disable the `stdfaxh.h` whatever
- This was the final command:
```bash
$ nasm -g -f elf64 hello.asm
$ g++ hello.cpp hello.o
$ ./a.out
```
- and the assembly file was:
```asm
;-------------------------------------------------
;               Ch02_01.asm
;-------------------------------------------------

; extern "C" int IntegerAddSub_(int a, int b, int c, int d);

;        .code
;IntegerAddSub_ proc
	global IntegerAddSub_         
	section .text
; Calculate a + b + c - d
IntegerAddSub_:
        mov eax,ecx                         ;eax = a
        add eax,edx                         ;eax = a + b
        add eax,r8d                         ;eax = a + b + c
        sub eax,r9d                         ;eax = a + b + c - d

        ret                                 ;return result to caller
;IntegerAddSub_ endp
;        end

```
- So I just had to add the `global IntegerAddSub_`, `section .text` below that, the name of the function as a section, and the last `ret` to follow `nasm` conventions.
- if using extern variables, use `extern g_val`, and then `default rel`

### 24/05/2021

138. Made a 3D print of dispatch with my sister. It was an awesome birthday.

139. Got DoctorDocstrings.jl Poster and Rubin.jl Lightning talk accepted to JuliaCon! Now to work on those asap...

140. Got the Kusswurm `Modern x86 Assembly Language Programming` and Min-Yih Hsu `LLVM Techniques` books in the mail now...

141. Should write down the Next steps for MMTK - a written down goal is usually an easier one. 

142.  üöÄ üíÉ To setup emojis, we can insert with `SPC i e`, but the line editor gets a bit funky...?

143. Found this incredibly useful [Doom emacs tips](https://gist.github.com/hjertnes/9e14416e8962ff5f03c6b9871945b165), and [this vim guide](https://gist.github.com/dmsul/8bb08c686b70d5a68da0e2cb81cd857f)

135. Vim tricks from Emacs doom! RTFM to change the font to Julia mono!
- `cc` in vim mode will let you change the whole line! 
- `C` changes to the end of the line!
- `*` to highlight all copies of the word under the cursor
- `~` to change the case of a letter, `[#]~` to change # chars after the letter under cursor. `g~[m]`, `gU[m]` `gu[m]` toggle cases with motion `[m]`
- `>[m]` to toggle case with motion `[m]`, `>>` to indent this line
- `J` to move line beneath to end of this one
- `gq[m]` format text between here and `[m]`, `gqq` formats current line
- *Marks*: `ma` sets a mark
- `'` and `''` to set a mark and jump back and forth between them

136. Kevin Bonham is helping me figure out the Emacs tabbing situation:
```
*Me*
Alright, I'm tired of never knowing how to work buffers or tabs or windows inside my doom emacs.
Who's got a good crash course?
My ideal goal is to:

1. Be able to open multiple buffers and move between them
2. Be able to set groups of tabs with different buffers
3. Be able to "restore" groups of tabs when starting up emacs.

*Kevin Bonham*
I've just been figuring this out myself...

1. SPC b b to switch buffers in the same window (assuming you've opened them before with SPC . or something.
    SPC w J (note the capital) will move the current buffer into a new window below (can also use H, K, or L) as last arg to do left, up, or right).
    Then do the same thing but lowercase to move focus around to different windows
2. SPC TAB has all of the tab-related things. SPC TAB n does new tab, SPC TAB r renames it, SPC TAB 1 to switch to tab 1 etc.
3. SPC p has all of the "project" related stuff. I haven't played a lot with these, but they seem to all be linked to a directory, though I think if you have outside files open, they will re-open with the project
```
### 17/05/2021

134. Wow-BOB-Wow has some nifty Rust tricks:
```rust
pub fn sum_of_multiples(limit: u32, factors &[u32]) -> u32 {
	(1..limit).filter(|i| factors.iter().any(|f| i % f == 0)).sum()
}
```

- For `perfect-numbers` don't forget it might be easier to match on 
```rust
match x.cmp(n) {
    Ordering::Greater => Some(Classification::Abundant),
	...
}
```

### 15/05/2021

133. 1.7 goodies! You can destructure structs with named tuples!
```julia
(; a, b) = x # destructures props `a` and `b` of `x`
```
Can also be used like:
```julia
struct A
	x
	y
end

foo((; x, y)::A) = x + y # ermahgerddd
```

`@test` can now be passed as an additional argument `skip` and `broken`:
```julia
@test isequal(complex(one(T)) / complex(T(Inf), T(-Inf)), complex(zero(T), zero(T))) broken=(T == Float64)
```

- You can also now iterate on a `RegexMatch` to get its captures!
- `Base.@invoke f(arg1::T1, arg2::T2; kwargs...) ` now resembles the `@ccall` syntax.
- Multidimiensional array syntax!
```julia
[ 1; 2 ;; 3 ; 4 ;; 5 ; 6 ;;; 7 ; 8 ;; 9 ; 10 ;; 11 ; 12]
```

### 14/05/2021

131. When making a PR to BinaryBuilder.jl, search the whole repo to make sure no one has tried building `jemalloc` before :upside-down: :tada:

132. Julia doesn't ship binaries yet, but [BOLT](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~ra045840/bolt-cgo19.pdf) could be worth looking into.

### 13/05/2021

129. Micket in the Julia chat has a nice answer for:
"How to do this neater?"
```julia
d = Dict("a" => 2, "b" => 3)
Dict(zip(keys(d), map(x -> 2x, values(d))))
# Do this!
map!(x -> 2x, values(d))
# Or this!
Dict( k => 2v for (k, v) in d)
```

130. `aur/julia-bin` is a good wrapper for Julia on Arch. Thanks Mos√®!


### 12/05/2021

128. If you append a julia Markdown bloc with `=` you get line numbers on HackMD.
```julia

```

### 11/05/2021

123. Fortran learnings!
1. Fortran people [have nice parallelism](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/accelerating-fortran-do-concurrent-with-gpus-and-the-nvidia-hpc-sdk/) concerns.
```fortran
do concurrent(i = 1:N)
    i0 = max(i - 1, 1)
    i1 = min(i + 1, N)
    b(:, :, 1) = 0.5 * (a(:, :, i0) + a(:, i1)) ! array assignment
end do
```
Can already be sent to Tesla GPUs o.O
2. In fortran, `functions` are `pure`, `subroutines` modify their arguments.
3. To make a struct, it probably suffices that
```fortran
type :: t_point
    real :: x
    real :: y
end type
```
And you access it with
```fortran
type(t_point) :: mypoint
mypoint%x = 1.0
mypoint%y = 2.0
```
4. You can declare fields in the struct as `private, protected, allocatable[dimension], pointer, codimension, contiguous, volatile, asynchronous`:
```fortran
type :: t_example
    integer, private:: i = 0 ! hites it from use outside of the t_example scope. Default init is with i = 0
    integer, protected :: i ! allowed access, but not definition outside of the scope
    real, allocatable, dimension(:) :: x
end type
```
5. You can `contains` *type-bound procedures*
```fortran
module m_shapes
implicit none
private
public t_square

type :: t_square
    real :: side
    contains
        procedure :: area
end type

contains
    real function area(self
    class(t_square), intent(in) :: self
    res = self%side**2
    end function
end module m_shapes
```

124. Peter Deffebach kindly helped me golf a really cool, [but simple task](https://twitter.com/miguelraz_/status/1392161937467731970):
```julia
using CSV, Glob
fs = CSV.File.(readdir(glob"*.csv"))
```
Done! You've read all the files `fs` that are CSVs!
```julia-repl
julia> using CSV, DataFrames, Glob;
julia> files = readdir(glob"*.csv");
julia> reduce(vcat, CSV.read(file, DataFrame) for file in files)
```

125. Jacob Zelko has kindly [shared some tools for dev flow]():
1. vim FloatTerm instead of vim-slime, don't need to open a pane that way.
2. `:MarkDownPreview` with `iamcoo/markdown-preview.nvim`.

### 10/05/2021

121. Tim Besard and Valentin Churavy kindly helped me out on the Julia users GPU call (available on the julialang.org calendar).
They noted a couple of good starting considerations:
1. Try and have a function that maps to every single element in the GPU.
2. Implementing a simple moving average is a type of convolution - there's good tutorials on optimizing that [here](http://alexminnaar.com/2019/07/12/implementing-convolutions-in-cuda.html) and [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/cuda-pro-tip-write-flexible-kernels-grid-stride-loops/).


### 09/05/2021

120. `git log -p -- path/to/file` will show you the commits you did to a file. Amazing!

### 07/05/2021

117. To write the Unicode Character `U+000A`, (Hat tip to Mason Protter), try this:
```julia
Char(0x000A) |> clipbaord
```
Thanks to Dave MacMaho, we can also do
```julia
'\U1f638'
```
and get the Cat emoji :D

118. Huh, forgot to add this nice pice of `@ccall` goodness from the `primecount_jll` stuff:
```julia-repl
julia> myprimecount(x) = @ccall libprimecount.primecount_pi(x::Clonglong)::Clonglong
myprimecount (generic function with 1 method)

julia> @time myprimecount(1e8)
  0.001004 seconds
5761455

julia> @time myprimecount(1e14)
  0.149201 seconds
3204941750802
```

119. We're dunking on the Fortran gang because they're 8x slower on a `sin` [benchmark](https://fortran-lang.discourse.group/t/simple-summation-8x-slower-than-in-julia/1171/48) :D
I'm glad I pulled out Steven Johnsons flags to cross compile a C lib to use it with `@ccall`:

```julia
shell> ls
cordic.c  cordic.h  cordic.html  cordic.sh

shell> gcc -fPIC -O3 -xc -shared -o libcordic.so cordic.c

shell> ls
cordic.c  cordic.h  cordic.html  cordic.sh  libcordic.so
```

I pulled that from their announcement of hte Julia [broadcasting features](https://julialang.org/blog/2017/01/moredots/) and the annex notebook [here](https://julialang.org/assets/blog/moredots/More-Dots.ipynb).

And here is how to call it:
```julia-repl
julia> function cordic_sine(a)

          cos = Ref{Float64}(0.0)
          sin = Ref{Float64}(0.0)

116. Simeon Schaub pulled some fancy destructuring:
```julia
x = [1, 2, 3]
x[3], x[1:2]... = x
@test x == [2, 3, 1]
```



### 05/05/2021

115. WE GOT JEFF TO STREAM SMALL STRING OPTIMIZATION!
Small lessons:
1. Big wieldy codebase? Work on one small, small change at a time. Cross bridges as you come to them.
2. Majority of strings don't need more than 128 bytes, so a single byte of addressing
3. Jeff uses `ack` for grepping the codebase
4. Before trying to compile, review your changes with a `git diff`
5. When getting a segmentation fault after making your changes and running `make`, run a debug build to figure out what went wrong with `make debug -j4`
6. `gdb /usr/bin/julia-debug` starts gdb, then `cd base/; r --output-ji x compile.ji` or something like that.
7. If you change header files you have to rebuild everything
8. Bonus: There's a docker image to start Julia Int32.
9. Multithread the `compiler.ji` step: multithread the code generator, break up into more code units...
10. set a breakpoint on `jl_throw` to see where `gdb` goes wrong. then `r -J ../usr/lib/julia/corecompiler.ji --output-ji x sysimg.jl`
11. rr magic: `rr record ../usr/bin/julia-debug -J ../usr/lib/julia/corecompiler.ji --output-ji x sysimg.jl`, then `rr replay`. `b jl_exceptionf` and then `rc` to "reverse continue" so that you can step backwards from what happened.
12. When an assertion fires, and you are in `gdb`, the location of the assertion in the source code is in frame 4, so, to jump to it you just start `gdb` and then `f 4`.(Usually just using `d bt` to look at the backtrace and figure out from there where to go.
13. You can call lisp (to reindent your emacs!) within the `gc.c` file!
14. Hah, I clicked the moment of [triump!](https://clips.twitch.tv/ExcitedSparklyTofuTheThing-I5DsaBoyOXcZ2KMw)
15. `../julia runtests.jl strings` to run the string test suite.

116. Remembered about `ArgParse.jl`. Noice:
```julia
s = ArgParseSettings()
@add_arg_table! s begin
    "--opt1"
        help = "an option with an argument"
    "--opt2", "-o"
        help = "another option with an argument"
        arg_type = Int
        default = 0
    "--flag1"
        help = "an option without argument, i.e. a flag"
        action = :store_true
    "arg1"
        help = "a positional argument"
        required = true
end
```

### 05/04/2021

114. Don't forget to turn off `cpuscaling` when running your benchmarks! Hat tip to [Camille Fournier](https://twitter.com/skamille/status/1389731461893349380) for schooling a bunch of us on this one!

[From this link:](https://nixcp.com/disable-cpu-frecuency-scaling/) we can do:
```bash
grep -E '^model name|^cpu MHz' /proc/cpuinfo
```

To figure out if the number on the left is lower than the number on the right. That's costing speed!
if you install `cpupowerutils(Centos/Debian)/ cpufrequtils (ubuntu / Debian)` you can do:
```bash
cpupower frequency-set -g performance
```


### 29/04/2021

113. Added a new recipe for `simdjson`. remember to add `supported_platforms(; experimental = true)` to try and run thigns on the new Mac M1 and `julia_compat = 1.6` to get the `cpuid` feature detection.
As always, Mos√® helped tons. He rocks.

### 28/04/2021

112. Como deshacer tu [ultimo git commit](https://midu.dev/como-deshacer-el-ultimo-commit-git/)
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
git reset --hard HEAD~1
git commit --ammend -m "este es el mensaje correcto"
git add f.txt
git commit --ammend -m "mensaje del commit"
# Si esta pushed...
git revert 74a...
```

### 27/04/2021

109. `launch=false` config for `CUDA.jl` helps set `peakflops`. Current NVIDIA 860M sets clocks in about 5.6e11.

110. MichaelHatherly's `InteractiveErrors.jl` is amazing. I should add it to a growing list of REPL tools.

111. `cd -` jumps you back to the last dir. Also found [command line libs in Rust](https://lib.rs/command-line-utilities):
- exa, bat, git-tui, git-delta, hunter, and bandwhich
- `grex`, `navi`, and `typeracer`: use more often!

### 22/04/2021

107. Finally reinstalled `CUDA.jl` stuff. Some good pointers:
- install the `linuxXXX-headers` and `linuxXXX-nvidia` to get compat stuff, then `sudo pacman -Sy cuda` to get all the  goodies or `CUDA_full_jll`. Big thanks to Time Besard and the `#gpu` gang for the setup.
- It's important to know the full memory model. Yupei Qi was very kind to recommend the [GTC On Demand videos](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gtc/on-demand/) and this [Architecture whitepaper](https://www.microway.com/download/whitepaper/NVIDIA_Maxwell_GM204_Architecture_Whitepaper.pdf)
- This is a good script to figure out the ideal launch config via the occupancy api (üé© to Valentin Churavy )
```julia-repl
julia> using CUDA
julia> function mykernel()
         nothing
       end
mykernel (generic function with 1 method)
julia> myconfig(kernel) = (@show kernel; (threads=1, blocks=1))
myconfig (generic function with 1 method)
julia> @cuda config=myconfig mykernel()
```
- It is **critical** to use the `nsys` profiler to figure out the full occupancy and the SMs in your systems. Ignore the CUDA cores, those are more marketing.`nsys launch julia` is very useful for getting this setup.


108. Put up StagedFilters.jl on Discord. With `LoopVectorization.jl`, we get up to 300x performance increase on some systems vs SciPy. I should make a release as I go forward
- Roadmap: Add a GPU method, add calculating the derivatives in a single pass


### 20/04/2021

105. Ooops - turns out I didn't use a copy of `main` branch for the tutorials so someone has to update by hadn a bunch of stuff :((((

106. `BinaryBuilder.supported_platforms(exlclude = Sys.islinux)` - where have you been all this time?

### 18/04/2021

104. Great day! Wrote the DataFrames.jl tutorials in Spanish, like 13 notebooks in a day. Vim skills paid off big time!

### 14/04/2021

102. Almost clinching the BB recipe for `racket`. This will help build Herbie! In BinaryBuilder.jl, Mos√® recommends, instead of 
```bash
cp racket/bin/* ${prefix}/
# try doing
cp -r racket/bin ${prefix}/.
```

103. Possible TODO? Stefan posted on [Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/julia-is-eight-times-slower-than-go-on-numerical-scheme/59383/29?u=miguelraz):
> There‚Äôs an old issue to [allow type annotations on global variables](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/964). **This would be a great intro compiler project** ‚Äî not trivial by any means, but relatively straightforward. The right approach would need to be discussed with the compiler team, but I suspect the it would be to associate a type with each global binding and automatically insert a type check at each global assignment and teach the compiler that it can assume that the type of each global access has the associated type. An untyped global would then have type Any, so all globals would work the same way. Some subtleties for usability: you‚Äôll want to at least allow redeclaring the same global with the same type so that code can be re-included interactively; you could also allow the type annotation to be made more restrictive since any code that‚Äôs already been generated with that assumption will still be correct; to be really fancy, one could add ‚Äúback edges‚Äù from global binding types to methods that use those globals and increase the world age / invalidate those methods, which would allow arbitrary re-declaration of type globals at the cost of recompiling any methods that accessed the global.

### 13/04/2021

100. Submitted GSoC app. Godspeed. Go go Rubin.jl!

101. In BinaryBuilder.jl, `cd ${prefix}/` is where all compilation targets are placed. 
Also, RTFM! Specifically platform hijinks.

### 11/04/2021

98. We got invited to give a conference talk at Alpine2021 because of a [tweet](https://twitter.com/miguelraz_/status/1381041713725153283) I sent to Alpine's main dev, Ariadne Conill.
Now to coordinate a cool talk/proposal with Mos√® and Elliot and show off cool Julia stuff.

99. FINALLY got Lean4 working on VSCode. Still don't know how to use `nix` but oh well. Halfway through the manual, and this example was neat to grok:
```lean
def add1Times3FilterEven (xs : List Nat) :=
	-- this
	--   List.filter (. % 2 == 0) (List.map (. * 3) (List.map (. + 1) xs))
	-- becomes this
	--   xs |> List.map (. + 1) |> List.map (. * 3) |> List.filter (. % 2 == 0)
	-- becomes THIS!
	xs |>.map (. + 1) |>.map (. * 3) |>.filter (. % 2 == 0)
```

In the same note: `x |> f` in Lean is the same as `f <| a`, which in Haskell means `f $ a`. Damn, that's some crappy ascii in Haskell :/

### 08/04/2021

97. Spawning a `run(...)` can take 2x more allocations from one system to another!
```julia-repl
julia> using primecount_jll

julia> @time run(`$(primecount()) 1e14`); # can be 2x allocations in other systems!
3204941750802
  0.150116 seconds (468 allocations: 33.891 KiB)
```

92. Woke up to the `primecount_jll` post getting tons of love, awesome! Hat tip to Stefan Karpsinski and Carsten Bauer for alley-ooping this.

93. Need to remember the `@doc` macro exists to document code not necessarily next to a function declaration - need to add a dispatch to DoctorDocstrings.jl for this case.

94. Ah right, forgot the `make -j${proc}` flag for a parallel BBuilder recipe, thanks to Mos√® for [catching that again](https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/Yggdrasil/pull/2779/files)

95. Mos√® points out [that it's not too hard to look at the warning logs](https://dev.azure.com/JuliaPackaging/Yggdrasil/_build/results?buildId=9980&view=results) emmitted from the PR - that's
how he was ble to spot that `CompilerSupportLibraries` was missing, and some other warnings needed to be addressed.

96. How to easily create a function that updates its own internal state? Use a closure! [ Like this](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/in-julia-how-to-create-a-function-that-saves-its-own-internal-state/58457/4?u=miguelraz)
```julia-repl
julia> f(state=0) = ()->state+=1
f (generic function with 2 methods)

julia> foo = f()
#7 (generic function with 1 method)

julia> foo()
1

julia> foo()
2

julia> foo()
3

julia> foo.state
Core.Box(3)

julia> foo.state.contents
3
```

### 05/04/2021

86. Chris Elrod with the amazing hint that `@code_native` has a `syntax=:intel` or `syntax=:att` flag!

87. Nice idea during the vacation: need to get
- list of all the conditions passed to the integrator and find a way to shove them into the type system.
- just ignore the commented rules, they don't pass those cases anyways :/
- find the first comment symbol "/;", (Only 8 are excluded), and slurp with regex the lhs := rhs /; assumptions
- make sure to separate the assumptions so that the weird list syntax doesn't creep in.

88. [up](https://github.com/akavel/up) Ultimate Plumber is absolutely amazing at ripgreppin' files and seeing results in real time. Someone rewrite it in Rust already!

89. Hmmm - what about just simply checking if there is a `With[...]`, and doing straight string replacement?

90. Don't forget about using `Traceur.jl`!, just drop a `@trace foo(3)` and keep going.

My workflow goes like this:

- `cat` a file into up: `cat file.txt | up`
- setup pipes for grepping and counting `rg "foo" | rg --invert-match "bar" | wc`

91. I made a [cool tutorial](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/number-of-primes-below-a-given-number/58709/21?u=miguelraz) on making a BinaryBuilder.jl recipe for `primecount` a bleeding edge
algorithm library for counting primes in in C/C++.

### 31/03/2021

85. Made public advances on Rubin.jl today. Turns out you can call (Within Mathematica)
`FullForm[Hold[...]]` and that will give you the S-expression for the whole thing.

Now to parse that into Julia full fledged.

### 26/03/2021

81. Apply a `SymbolicUtils.Rewriters.If(cond, rw)` to get the "facts" of our intrules.

82. Somebody can export every single DiffEq method to Fortran with some cleverness and `FortranTarget()` shenanigans in Symbolics.jl hmmmmm

83. `@less @which @edit @functionloc` all work the same!

84. Finally got to forwarding a GitHub fork to a new changes! Here's how:
```
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git rebase upstream/master
git push -f origin master
```
Kindly [taken from here](https://gist.github.com/ravibhure/a7e0918ff4937c9ea1c456698dcd58aa).

### 25/03/2021

78. Instead of `Base.OneTo(n)`, use `axes(A, i)` (Thanks Mason!), like so:
```julia
julia> A = [rand() for i in 1:1000, j in 1:1000];julia> function do_add4!(A)
           n = sizeof(A)[1]
           for j = Base.OneTo(n)
               for i = Base.OneTo(n)
                   @inbounds A[i,j] += 1.0
               end
           end
       end
```

Chris Elrod mentions that unless the `Base.OneTo` isn't being fed to an inlined function, it doesn't work for much.

79. Mason also recommends `oneunit` instead of `one` as it works with arbitrary number types. BORKED though, disregard.

80. This also works:

```julia
julia> using LoopVectorization
julia> A = # 1000 x 1000 rand float32s
julia> @avxt A .* 1f0 # multithreaded and AVX512 on platforms that support it
```

81. I should start contributing more to LoopVectorization.jl...

### 23/03/2021

73. Derp - remember, it's `match(regex, string).captures[index]`

74.	`FileTrees` needed a `path(file) |> string` instead of a `File`.

75. This whole thing parses and writes to a JSON3 array within 10 seconds. That rules!

76. To write files into the `MyPkg.jl` directory when activated Sukera suggests
```julia
joinpath(@__DIR__, "my_new_file.json")
```

77. HELL YES RUBIN.JL LIVESSSS


### 22/03/2021

70. `ArtifactUtils.jl` rules! just `add_artifact!` and you're almost good to go.

71. Need to work with a gajillion files in a folder and map the same transform to them lazily? Use FileTrees.jl for all your multithreaded directed needs!

72. Hmmm some of the Rubi rules are ... commented? Hope I don't end up writing a full Mathematica to Julia transpiler...

### 17/3/2021

So yeah, it's been a while. Back on the saddle again.

68. `Meta.show_sexpr` is super cool.

69.  This works!

```julia
for c in IOBuffer(mymultilinestring)
	foo(c)
end
```

70. Project Euler is coming along nicely. I should start on Rubi and put those freaking AdventOfCodeParsing skills to the test...


### 16/12/2020

66. Alex Arslan coming in again with the hot tips: If you want to parse a string into an expression (I need it to call the last REPL history line with `@edit`)
you can use `Meta.parse("3^2") == :(3 ^ 2)`.

67. Whooops. Shipped `DoctorDocstrings.jl` today. Best way to figure out if you have a bug is to ship it to production. Problem is that the `jldoctest` expects the output to be `display`ed just after
the REPL input, so I need to paste the code there. I think I can handle it...
`display` is the function to print to the REPL, btw.

### 15/12/2020

65. Boy oh Boy. I started on DoctorDocstrings.jl. It's gonna be amazing.

### 14/12/2020

62. Retaking Matt Bauman's [Parallel workshop from JuliaCon 2019](https://github.com/mbauman/ParallelWorkshop2019/blob/master/040%20Multithreading.jl)
- Remember to accumulate into `Threads.Atomic{eltype(arr)}(zero(eltype(arr))` if updates are scarce.
- `Threads.atomic_add!` and friends aka `atomic_add!(r, A[i]) == r += A[i]`
- `using .Threads`
- Pattern: Initialize an accumulator, write an inner loop (independent for each loop), reduce the results at the end with another for loop
- BUT! Atomics can't yet handle complex numbers, or structs.
- Pattern: Make an array the size of the threads, `@threads for i in eachindex(A); R[threadid()] += A[i]`
There's 3 interesting distinctions for `@sync` and `@async`:
```julia
@time for i in 1:10 # takes about 10s
    sleep(1)
end
@time for i in 1:10 # about 0s
    @async sleep(1)
end
@time @sync for i in 1:10 # about 1s
    @async sleep(1)
end
```
You can `wait` for a task to block until it finishes or `fetch` to initizlize it now.

- `using Distributed`: You have 8 REPLs started on each computer. You gain finer control on which processor communicates with which.
- `nprocs(), myid(), @everywhere`,
- useful idiom: `for i in workers(); @spawnat i work(...); end`
- instead of manually partitioning the space and juggling indexes, try using
```julia
@distributed (+) for r in [(0:9999) .+ offset for offset in 0:10_000:r[end]-1]
    partial_pi(r)
end
```
- `@distributed` has special support for reductions - to save data movement. Good for reductions.
- `@pmap` over a reduction like `0:999` and `0:10000:r[end]-1` and then change it to `0:9999` and `0:1000000:r[end]-1` because you reduce the communication. Especially good for expensive inner loops that return a value. Creates a task per item in iter space.
- `SharedArray` will let all threads concurrently access same array! `using SharedArrays` should Just Work TM. Slower than threads, since you go to disk.
- Heads up - `SharedArrays` must be bits types - because they need to be Mmapped. Threading like behavior replacement on a single machine.
- You can initialize an `SharedArray` with an `init` function so that it starts up its own data in a sense.
- `@sync @distributed` needs to happen to wait for the correct results.
- `DistributedArray` Every worker has access to a different portion of the array. Let's the data do the work splitting.
- `fetch(@spawnat 2 A.localpart)` shows the data the DArray `A` has on worker 2.
- Pluses: Generic arrays, data itself splits the computation.

63. Got pretty well punked by a [Python gotcha](https://twitter.com/DahlitzF/status/1338384990040682498)
```julia-repl
julia> IdDict(true => "yes", 1 => "no", 1.0 => "maybe")
IdDict{Any,String} with 3 entries:
  true => "yes"
  1.0  => "maybe"
  1    => "no"
```
Vs

```julia-repl
julia> Dict(true => "yes", 1 => "no", 1.0 => "maybe")
Dict{Real, String} with 1 entry:
  1.0 => "maybe"
```
Fortunately, Stefan was able to convince some of use in  the Julia Slack that this is a desirable behavior - you should replace the keys of a dict when you do this, otherwise you will be very very unhappy.
Here's the relevant [implementations](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/0bedcdabeb21d0d244babb4a88c91ff75a15577f/base/float.jl#L534-L553) in the `decompose` function in Base.

Quoting Stefan from the Slack:
```
in 0.3 we didn‚Äôt hash equal keys the same, we considered the type, but it was really bad
worst problem was that the type of a dict changed the behavior
if you had a Dict{Any,String} and you used 1 and 1.0 as keys, they would end up in different slots; if you had a Dict{Float64,String} and you used 1 and 1.0 as keys, they would both end up in the 1.0 slot
the only ways to avoid that  badness were:
1. don‚Äôt auto-convert keys, which would be really annoying and fussy
2. figure out a good way to value-based key hashing efficiently
two major challenges:
1. make it fast for common types like ints and floats and reasonably fast for things like bigints and rationals
2. make it extensible so that people implementing their own numeric types can do so correctly
yes, package authors definitely extend 'Base.decompose' to have proper hashing.
```
NICE - [turned the confusion into a PR](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/38881)

64. Very nice solution to the wordcount exercise: with a `matchall` regex and a `foreach`.
```julia
function wordcount(sentence::AbstractString)
    words = matchall(r"[a-z]+'[a-z]+|[a-z0-9]+", lowercase(sentence))
    counts = Dict{AbstractString, Int}()
    foreach(w -> counts[w] = get(counts, w, 0) + 1, words)
    counts
end
```

### 11/12/2020

60. Exercism: Circular Buffer. A few informal interfaces define the ability of Julia to give you a lot of methods for free!
- `append!, empty!, pop!, pushfirst, setindex!, collect, eltype, first, getindex, isempty, iterate, last, length, size` are all "free" if you can properly subtype `<: AbstractVector`.
- I didn't need to keep a bunch of tracking vectors - sometimes just 2 Ints to signal where the `Head` (first writeable element) and `tail` first removable element are is enough additional info.
-

61. Omicron666 from Discord helps out with the syntax for nested for loops/iterations:
- `[10*i + j for i+1:M for j in i+1:N] # Do the first variable i, then the second without a comma`

### 7/12/2020

52. `parse(Int, "01010101", base=2)` to get a binary number directly is really nifty.

53. Remember to use the `lo, hi = extrema(xs)` function! Credit for a really elegant solution to JLLing.

54. Some really good learning about writing Iterators from [Eric Davies from Invenia](https://julialang.org/blog/2018/07/iterators-in-julia-0.7/)
- `IterTools.jl` is your friend.
- You need 2 `iterate` methods. YOu can be clever and use a kwarg, or if you aren't sure of the structure of the `state` arg, use `...`:
```julia
function iterate(it::TakeNth, state...)
    xs_iter = nothing

    for i = 1:it.interval
        xs_iter = @ifsomething iterate(it.xs, state...)
        state = Base.tail(xs_iter)
    end

    return xs_iter
end
```

55. To dump a TLA  file into a dot file, use `tlc -dump dot file.dot file.tla`. Then read it with
- Hmmmmm Strong connected concurrent components in LightGraphs.jl ? [link here](https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/blob/master/general/docs/contributions.md), [repo here](https://github.com/vbloemen/hong-ufscc)

56. [CodeCosts.jl](https://github.com/kimikage/CodeCosts.jlA) looks REALLLLLY cool for a [JuliaTooling] video soon...
```julia-repl

57. [DP by errichto:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBSt1jYwVfU)
- There's identical subproblems (think of the leaves of fibonacci(5))
- if it doesn't matter how you get to an intermediate state, then the dims of the dynamic program are `dp[N]`, with N states.
- Then think of the transition.
- When doing the minimum path sum through an array, take care to a) initialize the edges / boundaries, the first element
- build a copy of the initial data, and only update after doing the logic for the max/min logic.
- Brain hurts.

### 6/12/2020

51. Advent of Code 7 kicked my butt. HOWEVER! We rocked the parsing with some cool regexes.
- I couldn't solve the first one because I am not familiar with the concept of queues. Or stacks.

Again, Pablo Zubieta coming in with the fire code:
```julia
function fish(d)
    # if you only pop and append to the end of vectors, all is good
    queue = [k for (k, v) in d if haskey(v, "shiny gold")]
    found = Set(queue)
    while !isempty(queue)
        bag = pop!(queue)
        new = (k for (k, v) in d if haskey(v, bag))
        union!(found, new) # This is better than a push!
        append!(queue, new)
    end
    return length(found)
end
```
- So, the idea is I have `pop!`, `push!` and a `queue`.
- If you have a vector of `Pair`, you can sum them with `sum(last, pairs)`.
- For performant regexes [Specificity is king](https://www.loggly.com/blog/five-invaluable-techniques-to-improve-regex-performance/)
- Teo ShaoWei is using some very concise regexes and a very handy function to return named tuples:
```julia
# "nop +0"
# "acc +3"
# "jmp -99" expected inputs
function parse_input_line(line)
    m = match(r"^(\w{3}) ([-+]\d+)$", line
    return (op = m[1], val = parse(Int, m[2]))
end
```
From this we consider the following:
1. Consider having a function that parses a line at a time and passes a named tuple to the solver.
2. Don't be silly - if you already have code that finds the solution to something in part1... use it in part2. -_-.


### 5/12/2020

47. Advent of Code just keeps on rocking!

48. Exericisms review: checking if something is an isogram (no repeated letters):
```julia
isisogram(s) = allunique(i for i in lowercase(s) if isletter(i))
```

49. When defining your new types, make sure to use `promote_rule` appropriately. `Exercism:Complex Numbers:`
- `promote_rule(T1, T2) = foo(promote_type(T1,T2))`
- Remember to import `Base.abs, Base.exponent, Base.:+ ...`
- For funsies, try commenting out your `zero(x), one(x)` implementations and seeing if yoru algebra still works. (Should work regardless!)
- You can write `import Base: real, imag, conj, +, -, * ...` at the top of the file and then do `+(x::Complex, y::Complex)` without `Base.:`.
- Fooling around with rationals is no fun if you don't know the `copysign(x, y)` function: takes the magnitude of `x` with the sign of `y`. Removes
a lot of hacky logic.
- Note: `=> is for pairs, >= is boolean` o.0
- NOTE: Make sure that the tests are RIGHT. Not checking for a 0 denominator blew up in my face.
- If you want to print a custom type, overload `show` so that it `print`s what you want
```
  To customize human-readable text output for objects of type T, define
  show(io::IO, ::MIME"text/plain", ::T) instead. Checking the :compact IOContext
  property of io in such methods is recommended, since some containers show their
  elements by calling this method with :compact => true.
```
- `show(io::IO, x::RationalNumber) = print(io, num(x),"//",den(x))`
Now onto CustomSet:

- You can `merge(dict1, dict1)`.
- You can get the `keytype(d)`
- Great tip from Sascha Mann: To define `foo/foo!` combos, do `foo!(x) = ...` and then `foo(x) = foo!(copy(x))`
- When test sets fail eagerly, consider moving them "up" so that another property is tested first.
- Iteration is ~~hard~~ easier now than before, just figure out how to write the proper
```julia
iterate(s::CustomSet) = iterate(s.dict)
iterate(s::CustomSet, el) = iterate(s.dict, el)
```
50. Iterators galore! We had massive help from Sascha and Fliksel:
- LESSON: RETURN WHAT YOU WANT THE NEXT STATE TO BE
```julia-repl
julia> function Base.iterate(iter::Fibo, state = (0, (1,1))) # The 0 here will represent the "counter"
       if state[1] > iter.n
           return nothing
       end
       f1, f2 = state[2]
       return f1+f2, (state[1]+1, (f1+f2, f1))
       end
```
51. Note about iterators:
```julia
function Base.iterate(iter::Fibo, state = ...)
				        #  ^
					#  |
	counter = state[1] # <- this has to match with newstate
	if counter > iter.n
	    return nothing
	end

	# Clever calculations here
	newitem = foo(...)
	newstate = (bar(...), ...)
	# NOTE: the tuples must match up!
	# typeof(newstate) == typeof(state)
	return newitem, newstate

end
```



### 4/12/2020

42. Pablo Zubieta just absolutely shreked his Advent of Code Day04 problem: here's the learnings.
- Parsing to integers and then applying logic can be done within a regex itself.
- Just check for the actual cases that need to be satisfied with the characters themselves, no need to lift them into ints.
- A good strategy is to separate your cases with `|` and put a word boundary at the end `\b`.
- It's zero allocations!

```julia
const input = split(String(read("input")), r"\n\n")

const fields1 = (r"byr", r"iyr", r"eyr", r"hgt", r"hcl", r"ecl", r"pid")
const fields2 = (
    r"byr:(19[2-9][0-9]|200[0-2])\b",
    r"iyr:20(1[0-9]|20)\b",
    r"eyr:20(2[0-9]|30)\b",
    r"hgt:(1([5-8][0-9]|9[0-3])cm|(59|6[0-9]|7[0-6])in)\b",
    r"hcl:#[0-9a-f]{6}\b",
    r"ecl:(amb|blu|brn|gry|grn|hzl|oth)\b",
    r"pid:\d{9}\b"
)

# Part 1
count(p -> all(t -> contains(p, t), fields1), input)

# Part 2
count(p -> all(t -> contains(p, t), fields2), input)
```

43. Instead of
```julia
if !haskey(d, str)
    d[str] = 1
elseif
    haskey(d, str)
    d[str] += 1
else
    ...
end
```
You can try
```julia
d[str] = get(d, s, 0) + 1
```

44. Revisiting Exercisms is a good way to hone skills. Instead of
```julia
a, b, c = dict[c[1]], dict[c[2]] dict[c[3]]
# vs
a, b, c = (dict[c[i]] for i in 1:3)
```

45. Remember to check for type instabilities in the code with `@code_warntype`.

46. Stacking generators within generators is tricky, but `joshua-whittemore` has a trick (Exercism-ETL)
```julia
function transform(input::Dict)
    Dict(
         lowercase(letter) => value
         for (value, letters) in input
         for letter in letters
    )
end
```



### 2/12/2020

37. Beast of a solution with great help from Colin:
```julia
function solutions(str)
    sol1, sol2 = 0, 0
    for line in readlines(str)
        lo, hi, (char,), pass = match(r"^(\d+)-(\d+) (\w): (.+)$", line).captures
        lo, hi = parse.(Int, (lo, hi))
        sol1 += lo <= count(==(char), pass) <= hi
        sol2 += (pass[lo] == char) ‚äª (pass[hi] == char)
    end
    sol1, sol2
end
```
The `match(r"...", line).captures` immediately splits and gets the appropriate strings, and `(char,)` is a tuple decomposition of a container with a single element, (similar to `(a,b) = [3 4]`).

38. Regex has many smart functions
```julia
Regex("[regex]")
r"[regex]"
match(needle, haystack)
~~matchall(needle, haystack)~~
eachmatch(needle, haystack)
ismatch(needle, haystack)
```

39. If I have `str = "Roll On The Floor"` and I want to match on each first character to get the acronym, I can use `getproperty(m, :match)` for that:
```julia
r = eachmatch(r"\b[a-zA-Z]", str)
join(getproperty(r[i], :match) for i in 1:length(r))
```

40. Count is really nifty:
```julia-repl
julia> xs = "#..##."
"#..##."

julia> count("#", xs)
3
```
These "curried" operators can be found with `rg Fix[12]`, or `help?> Fix1`

!!! You can implement this for your own methods with `Base.Fix2{typeof(func)}`: `contains(needle) = Base.Fix2(contains, needle)`

41. When dealing with parsing strings by hand, split can sometimes give useless empty strings that muck up the analysis later on. Use the `kw` `keepempty=false` to get rid of those spurious results! For an example, check the AdventOfCodeDay04 code.


### 1/12/2020

35. Advent of code day 01: cool tricks:

36. Advent of code day 02: Cool tricks:
- remember that `'a' != "a"`. If ASCII `"a"[1]` works, and in other cases, use `only()`.
- Even better, as `@tommyxr` points out, just do `==(letter)`.


### 21/11/2020

33. Credit to `@Suker`: REPL interactivity can be drastically helped (and enhanced with Revise.jl) if you have the following:
- working on a script that may have some big g Global parameter everywhere,
- put those in a function `main()` and put `!isinteractive() && main()` at the end of the file

34. Reading the SciML dev docs:
- To add a new package to the common interface, define the types
 ```julia
abstract type AnalyticAlgorithm <: DiffEqBase.AbstractAnalyticAlgorithm
 ```
 - specify type parameters for concrete algos
 ```julia
struct analytic{Simple} <: AnalyticAlgorithm{Simple} end
analytic(; simple = true) = analytic{simple}()
 ```
 - overload `__solve` from `DiffEqBase.jl`

### 19/11/2020

31. Chris de Graaf suggested instead of using `const A = [1]`, try using a `Ref`:
```julia
# access a ref with []
A = Ref(0)
A[] = 1
A[] == 1 # true
```
Takes a bit more nanoseconds to access than a 1 sized array but is sized `()`.

32. Execution matters more than hoarding ideas. [Decent Talk by John Cormack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSCBCk4xVa0). Enjoy the insight high, then get down in the mud and try to bust your own idea.

### 15/11/2020

26. Al final empec√© el manual en espa√±ol. Parece que `Laura Ventosa` va a ser buena mancuerna para este proyecto. Qu√© chido. La [traduccion del manual esta en este link](https://github.com/miguelraz/julia-es-manual).

27. Copy pasting to the system clipboard in Vim is easier with `select the text -> "+y`. Also `t` will go to just before a character `F` will search a char backwards, and `}` will go to the end of a paragraph.

28. It seems the `Savitzky-Golay` filter is very - VERY - interesting for a lot of computing people. Really need to get into parallelizing it and figuring out the GPU part.
- [ ] Investigate why it was not 4x as fast with Float32s as with Float64s.
- [ ] Check for other applications [in this cool presentaiton](https://sites.middlebury.edu/dunham/files/2017/07/MC2-004-Signal-Processing-in-a-Physics-Experiment-2017-July-11-FINAL.pdf)

29. Started on Pochoir.jl. Godspeed.

30. Oh god. SymbolicUtils.jl can revive IntegralTransforms.jl.

### 14/11/2020

25. Found an absolutely amazing post about learning Z3 as if it were [Lisp syntactically](https://www.craigstuntz.com/posts/2015-03-05-provable-optimization-with-microsoft-z3.html).
Should definitely look into this further. I think some Z3 and TLA+ are more than enough formal methods for a while...
There's even an online [editor that seems useful for prototyping](https://rise4fun.com/Z3/7VZh)


### 13/11/2020

18. Counting neighbours / minesweeping? Ran into this problem on the [Exercsim](https://exercism.io/my/solutions/fae14489bd9b4de1bc5283815f0e66ac) earlier today:

```julia
sum(arr[i][j] .== "*") #where j = 1:3
```
is a no-no. First, we have to remember to compare `Char`s to `Char`s, since
```julia
"*" == '*' # false
'*' == '*' # true
```
A correct approach looks like:
```julia
sum(arr[i][j] == '*' for j in idxs)
```
by use of some spiffy generator syntax.

19. Maybe time for someone to write a fast `neighbours(arr, i, j)` function in a package and PR it to LinAlg? Credit to Sascha Mann. Use views to make it fast.
Kick it up a notch: make it N-Dimensional, and performant!

20. You can't do `a = "abc"; a[2] = '3';`, or `'3' != Char(3)`, because STRINGS ARE IMMUTABLE!

21. [`Vyu`](https://exercism.io/tracks/julia/exercises/minesweeper/solutions/2c776b090173426eb160cea17a85e536#solution-comment-170293) has an amazing solution for summing up neighbours in a Matrix:
```julia
function sumAdjacent(array, xy::CartesianIndex{2})
    x, y = xy.I
    lenX, lenY = size(array)
    v = view(
        array,
        max(1, x - 1):min(lenX, x + 1),
        max(1 ,y - 1):min(lenY, y + 1)
    )
    sum(v)
end
```
22. [bovine3dom]() has a solution for a hypercube minefield:
```julia
# This function works for hypercube minefields too, which is pretty cool.
# If you decide to construct your own hypercube minefield, bear in mind that
# the curse of dimensionality means that mines become useless as the number of
# dimensions increases to even moderate numbers.
#
# (A more useful metric for 'danger from mines' is the percentage of neighbouring
# cells which contain mines).
function flag_mines(matrix::Array)
    flagged = zeros(Int,size(matrix))
    @inbounds for inds in Tuple.(CartesianIndices(matrix))
        flagged[inds...] = matrix[inds...] == 1 ? -1 : sum(window(matrix,inds,ones(Int,length(size(matrix)))))
    end
    flagged
end
```
23. The cleanest minefield answer might be `OTDE`...
```julia
annotate(minefield) = [
    replace(
        join(
            w[c] == '*' ? '*' :
            count(get(get(minefield, y, ""), x, "") == '*'
            for x in (c - 1):(c + 1)
                for y in (r - 1):(r + 1)
                    if x != c || y != r)
        for c in 1:length(w)),
    '0' => ' ')
    for (r, w) in enumerate(minefield)
]
```
Lessons:
- a nested generator can be quite powerful
- don't be afraind to use dictionary combos with `for (r, w) in enumerate(xs)`
- This looks intimidating as hell. I don't think I could recode this in a few months.

24. DID NOT KNOW you could iterate a dictionary if you didn't care about order:
```julia
samples = Dict(
	"I" => 1,
	"II" => 2,
	"V" => 5,
	)
for sample in samples
	@test to_roman(sample[1]) == sample[2]
end
```

### 12/11/2020

17. Invaluable git trick: if you committed some changes locally, but someone else pushed to master, use the [auto-rebase autostash trick](https://cscheng.info/2017/01/26/git-tip-autostash-with-git-pull-rebase.html):

```
git config --global pull.rebase true
git config --global rebase.atuoStash true
```
so that you don't need to do `git pull --rebase --autostash` and can just `git pull`.

10. Try and order starter kit / computer parts from newegg.com

11. Before you spend a day trying to scrape / download files, make sure the author did not already kindly include a zipped version of the files :clown_face:

12. I think I found a possible thesis project - SymbolicUtils.jl as a backend for SymbolicTensors.jl. I should message the author and set something up.

13. Ran into rulebasedintegration.org. Downloaded the Mathematica notebooks, found a way to parse and dump them into text with PDFIO.jl.

14. Remembered how to setup an `artifact` with ArtifactUtils.jl. That thing is useful.

15. Found a killer command from SOverflow on how to recursively copy all files in a tree of folders that match an extension into a target directory:

 - whelp I think I lost it. Will fish it back but it was an easy google.

 16. Polytomous recommended ["Taguette"](www.taguette.org) for highlighting documents and its open source. Super cool! Should send to Ponzi.

### 06/11/2020

9. If you want to make your startup super fast, use `PackageCompiler.jl`:
```julia-repl
julia> using PackageCompiler
julia> create_sysimage([:Revise, :OhMyREPL, :BenchmarkTools], replace_default = true)
```
Super charge that combo with the `~/.julia/config/startup.jl`:
```julia-repl
julia> try
           using Revise
       catch e
	   @warn(e)
       end
```


### 04/11/2020

7. Trump is likely gonna lose the election - crazy times. Been working a bit on scaffolding for LightGraphsIO.jl. Solid integration with Parsers.jl will mean a lot of speed coming up for the LightGraphs.jl ecosystem.

8. In order to not get punked by the output of

```julia-repl
julia> print.(sq(i) for i in 1:10)
14916253649648110010-element Vector{Nothing}:
nothing
nothing
nothing
nothing
nothing
nothing
nothing
nothing
nothing

```

`@pabloferz` suggested the `foreach`, which returns a `nothing`, and thus doesn't print.

```julia-repl
julia> foreach(x -> println(x^2), 1:3:7)
1

49
```


### 31/10/2020

6. Today I finally got around to rewriting `GraphsIO.jl`. It suffered from a few ailments:
 - Very, very wonky pythonic dispatch
 - Small performance hits when writing (ie, not using `io = IOBuffer()`, `write(io, s1, s2)` instead of the allocating `write(io, "$s1$s2")`, etc.
 - Very awkward test scaffolding. Figuring out which functions are being called is just not fun.
 - Bulky directory structure. I'll just monorepo it for now and see what sticks.
 - Poor documentation.

I adopted the `Blue Style` guidelines because they came in with PkgTemplates.jl and screw it, why not try and follow them.
Here's what I got done today:
 - Testing scaffolding mostly setup. (Files, how to run the tests, etc.)
 - Writing graphs in DOT, and I think 3 other formats.
 - Minor performance improvements.

Tomorrow I should start something fun with the Parsers.jl library for maximum speedups. Wish me luck!

### 29/10/2020

1. Closures! Defining a function within a function is a type of closure. They take variables from one scope above them. `@masonprotter` and `@fredrikekre` helped me figure out why having this is desirable:

```julia-repl
julia> function f(x, y, z)
           data = compute(x, y, z)

           g() = data^2 # closure over data
           g() # call g here maybe?
           # ...
           g() # maybe again here?
end
```

Mason says:"Almost all usages of closures can be replaced with 'top level' functions that take extra arguments (one for each captured field), but it's syntactically less pleasing and can end up causing you to have a bunch of function names in your namespace you don't want."
Of course [there's a Discourse post on it](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/closures-section-in-documentation-is-not-clear-enough/18717/13).

2. Wow! [Function composition and piping](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/functions/#Function-composition-and-piping) lets you do some amazing stuff with `\circ<TAB>` and friends!

```julia-repl
julia> (sqrt ‚àò +)(3, 6)
3.0
julia> map(first ‚àò reverse ‚àò uppercase, split("you can compose functions like this")
6-element Array{Char,1}:
 'U': ASCII/Unicode U+0055 (category Lu: Letter, uppercase)

  "A"
  "tsil"
  "Of"
 7
julia> (^2, sqrt, inv).([2,4,4])
[4,2, .25]
```

3. Rust allows for defining anonymous functions!

```rust
fn raindrops(n: u32) -> String {
	let is_factor = |f| x % f == 0;
	...
}
```

4. Rust match is very powerful... try and setup the anonymous functions in a tuple after the `match` and then filter by `(each, available, case) => action`.
```plaintext
pub fn raindrops(num: i64) -> String {
    let mut raindrop = String::new();

    match (num % 3, num % 5, num % 7) {
        (0, 0, 0) => raindrop.push_str("PlingPlangPlong"),
        (0, 0, _) => raindrop.push_str("PlingPlang"),
        (0, _, 0) => raindrop.push_str("PlingPlong"),
        (_, 0, 0) => raindrop.push_str("PlangPlong"),
        (0, _, _) => raindrop.push_str("Pling"),
        (_, 0, _) => raindrop.push_str("Plang"),
        (_, _, 0) => raindrop.push_str("Plong"),
        (_, _, _) => raindrop = num.to_string()
    }

    return raindrop
}
```

5. This was a good use of match

```plaintext
pub fn square(s: u32) -> u64 {
    match s {
        1...64 => 1u64.wrapping_shl(s-1),
// This also works
//      1u64 << (s - 1)
        _ => panic!("Square must be between 1 and 64"),
    }
}

pub fn total() -> u64 {
    (1..65).map(square).sum()
// Lol thanks philip98
// u64::max_value
}
```
