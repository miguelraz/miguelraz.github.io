1. Closures! Defining a function within a function is a type of closure. They take variables from one scope above them. `@masonprotter` and `@fredrikekre` helped me figure out why having this is desirable:

```julia-repl
function f(x, y, z)
    data = compute(x, y, z)

    g() = data^2 # closure over data    
    g() # call g here maybe?    
    # ...    
    g() # maybe again here?
end
```

Mason says:"Almost all usages of closures can be replaced with 'top level' functions that take extra arguments (one for each captured field), but it's syntactically less pleasing and can end up causing you to have a bunch of function names in your namespace you don't want."
Of course [there's a Discourse post on it](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/closures-section-in-documentation-is-not-clear-enough/18717/13).
 
2. Wow! [Function composition and piping](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/functions/#Function-composition-and-piping) lets you do some amazing stuff with `\circ<TAB>` and friends!

```julia-repl
julia> (sqrt ∘ +)(3, 6)
3.0
julia> map(first ∘ reverse ∘ uppercase, split("you can compose functions like this")
6-element Array{Char,1}:
 'U': ASCII/Unicode U+0055 (category Lu: Letter, uppercase)
 'N': ASCII/Unicode U+004E (category Lu: Letter, uppercase)
 'E': ASCII/Unicode U+0045 (category Lu: Letter, uppercase)
...
julia> 1:10 |> sum |> sqrt
7.416...
julia> (sqrt ∘ sum)(1:10)
7.41...
julia> [ "a", "list", "of", "strings"] .|> [uppercase, reverse, titlecase, length]
4-element Array{Any,1}:
  "A"
  "tsil"
  "Of"
