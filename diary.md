7. Trump is likely gonna lose the election - crazy times. Been working a bit on scaffolding for LightGraphsIO.jl. Solid integration with Parsers.jl will mean a lot of speed coming up for the LightGraphs.jl ecosystem.

8. In order to not get punked by the output of 

```julia-repl
julia> print.(sq(i) for i in 1:10)
14916253649648110010-element Vector{Nothing}:
nothing
nothing
nothing
nothing
nothing
nothing
nothing
nothing
nothing
nothing
```

`@pabloferz` suggested the `foreach`, which returns a `nothing`, and thus doesn't print.

```julia-repl
julia> foreach(x -> println(x^2), 1:3:7)
1
9
49
```

6. Today I finally got around to rewriting `GraphsIO.jl`. It suffered from a few ailments:
 - Very, very wonky pythonic dispatch
 - Small performance hits when writing (ie, not using `io = IOBuffer()`, `write(io, s1, s2)` instead of the allocating `write(io, "$s1$s2")`, etc.
 - Very awkward test scaffolding. Figuring out which functions are being called is just not fun.
 - Bulky directory structure. I'll just monorepo it for now and see what sticks.
 - Poor documentation.

I adopted the `Blue Style` guidelines because they came in with PkgTemplates.jl and screw it, why not try and follow them.
Here's what I got done today:
 - Testing scaffolding mostly setup. (Files, how to run the tests, etc.)
 - Writing graphs in DOT, and I think 3 other formats.
 - Minor performance improvements.

Tomorrow I should start something fun with the Parsers.jl library for maximum speedups. Wish me luck!

1. Closures! Defining a function within a function is a type of closure. They take variables from one scope above them. `@masonprotter` and `@fredrikekre` helped me figure out why having this is desirable:

```julia-repl
function f(x, y, z)
    data = compute(x, y, z)

    g() = data^2 # closure over data    
    g() # call g here maybe?    
    # ...    
    g() # maybe again here?
end
```

Mason says:"Almost all usages of closures can be replaced with 'top level' functions that take extra arguments (one for each captured field), but it's syntactically less pleasing and can end up causing you to have a bunch of function names in your namespace you don't want."
Of course [there's a Discourse post on it](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/closures-section-in-documentation-is-not-clear-enough/18717/13).
 
2. Wow! [Function composition and piping](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/functions/#Function-composition-and-piping) lets you do some amazing stuff with `\circ<TAB>` and friends!

```julia-repl
julia> (sqrt ∘ +)(3, 6)
3.0
julia> map(first ∘ reverse ∘ uppercase, split("you can compose functions like this")
6-element Array{Char,1}:
 'U': ASCII/Unicode U+0055 (category Lu: Letter, uppercase)
 'N': ASCII/Unicode U+004E (category Lu: Letter, uppercase)
 'E': ASCII/Unicode U+0045 (category Lu: Letter, uppercase)
...
julia> 1:10 |> sum |> sqrt
7.416...
julia> (sqrt ∘ sum)(1:10)
7.41...
julia> [ "a", "list", "of", "strings"] .|> [uppercase, reverse, titlecase, length]
4-element Array{Any,1}:
  "A"
  "tsil"
  "Of"
 7
julia> (^2, sqrt, inv).([2,4,4])
[4,2, .25]
```

3. Rust allows for defining anonymous functions!

```rust
fn raindrops(n: u32) -> String {
	let is_factor = |f| x % f == 0;
	...
}
```

4. Rust match is very powerful... try and setup the anonymous functions in a tuple after the `match` and then filter by `(each, available, case) => action`.
```rust
pub fn raindrops(num: i64) -> String {
    let mut raindrop = String::new();

    match (num % 3, num % 5, num % 7) {
        (0, 0, 0) => raindrop.push_str("PlingPlangPlong"),
        (0, 0, _) => raindrop.push_str("PlingPlang"),
        (0, _, 0) => raindrop.push_str("PlingPlong"),
        (_, 0, 0) => raindrop.push_str("PlangPlong"),
        (0, _, _) => raindrop.push_str("Pling"),
        (_, 0, _) => raindrop.push_str("Plang"),
        (_, _, 0) => raindrop.push_str("Plong"),
        (_, _, _) => raindrop = num.to_string()
    }

    return raindrop
}
```

5. This was a good use of match

```rust
pub fn square(s: u32) -> u64 {
    match s {
        1...64 => 1u64.wrapping_shl(s-1),
// This also works
//      1u64 << (s - 1)
        _ => panic!("Square must be between 1 and 64"),
    }
}

pub fn total() -> u64 {
    (1..65).map(square).sum()
// Lol thanks philip98
// u64::max_value
}
```
