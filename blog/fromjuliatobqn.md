Here's the rough sketch of this blogpost:

1. I will give a brief intro to BQN and talk about its pros and cos
2. I will show a few Julia vs BQN code problems side by syde
3. I will argue that there's areas for Julians to draw inspiration from BQN
4. I will give a few resources at the end for you to dive deeper.

As usual, if you want to support my writings and open source work, [please consider sponsoring me on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/miguelraz/). I'm reaaaaally close to 50 monthly sponsors, and it makes a *huuuuge* difference in how much time/worries/resources I have for working on stuff like this.

Alright, on with the blogpost.

### Why is BQN is cool

1. It has fast multidimensional arrays
2. They love unicode
3. It has a REPL!
4. It's super at code golfing üèå
5. It's self hosted
6. They use JuliaMono! üíù
7. They're building a JIT!

Name: funny bacon puns. Also `"APL" .+ 1 == "BQM"`, but people noticed too late before the "bacon" puns began.
*BQN vs APL*:

### Getting started

- [BQN keyoard](https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/keymap.html)
- Tutorial
* Note: If you are going to try to use your terminal with the CQBN REPL (the fastest implementation), note that you will want to do `rlwrap -r BQN` to fire it up.
- The `nvim-bqn` interface is the best local option I've found.
- Remember to change your terminal font to JuliaMono, otherwiseyour code will be *even more unreadable* (at first!).


Range:

- 15 reshape range 10 # cycles!
- transpose 3_3

### Scripting

online REPL or download BQN repo and open with browser `BQN/docs/try.html` from their github repo.

Everything in green is a function
Everything in yellow is a 1 modifier
Everything in purple/pink is a 2 modifer

Defining `Hi` function

### REPL Duel

- Problems: `palindromes`, `count different words`, `Remove HTML Tags`


### Tutorial

### Julia vs BQN problems:

Here's a few "classic" problems in both Julia and BQN

1. Find the Hamming/edit distance between 2 strings:

```julia-repl
julia> dist(s1, s2) = count(((x,y),) -> x != y, zip(s1, s2))
dist (generic function with 1 method)

julia> dist("ACCAGGG", "ACTATGG")
2

julia> dist(s1, s2) = sum(map(!=, s1, s2)) # kudos to Michael Abbot for the broadcasting tip
dist (generic function with 1 method)

julia> dist(s1, s2) = mapreduce(!=, +, s1, s2) # kudos to J. Ling for this one
```

And in BQN:

```bqn
s1 ‚Üê "XXXXGGG"
s2 ‚Üê "ACTAGGG"
Sol ‚Üê +¬¥‚â†
s1 Sol s2 # 4
```

This is a neat `3 char solution` that Asher will no doubt be very proud of.

2. [Increasing Array](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1094/)

> You should take 3 minutes to go read the problem statement.

I like that after seeing the problem (you should go and click the link), I didn't think about a C++ but a BQN solution.
Here's my attempt:

```bqn
a ‚Üê 3‚Äø2‚Äø5‚Äø1‚Äø7
+¬¥a-Àú‚åà`a
Sol ‚Üê {+¬¥ùï©-Àú‚åà`ùï©}
Sol ‚Üê +¬¥‚àò(‚åà`-‚ä¢) # Asher's solution
Sol a
```

which in Julia I would write like

```julia-repl
julia> x = [3 2 5 1 7];
julia> sol(x) = accumulate(max, x) - x |> sum;
julia> sol(x);
```

Which took be a bit because `scanl` is called `accumulate` in Julia. Not too shabby.
(Extra kudos if you can get a non-allocating version working)

3. Maximum parenthesis depth


4. Remove HTML Tags
Problem spec:
> Given the string "<div>Hello <b>CppNorth!</b></div>", remove the HTML tags (underne

The following snippets are thanks to `dzaima` on the BQN Discord:

```bqn
   )t:10000000 {ùï©/Àú¬¨(‚â†`‚à®‚ä¢)(ùï©='>')‚à®ùï©='<'} "<div>Hello <b>CppNorth!</b></div>"
179.01ns
```

On a `make o3n-singeli` build (built for SIMD speedups):

```bqn
   )t:10000000 ¬¨‚àò(‚â†`‚à®‚ä¢)‚àò(=‚üú'>'‚à®=‚üú'<')‚ä∏/ "<div>Hello <b>CppNorth!</b></div>"
165.19ns
```

On a 100x longer input it rips at about 0.24ns/character (without a block):

```bqn
   ‚â†a‚Üê‚àæ100‚•ä<"<div>Hello <b>CppNorth!</b></div>"
3300
   )t:1000000 ¬¨‚àò(‚â†`‚à®‚ä¢)‚àò(=‚üú'>'‚à®=‚üú'<')‚ä∏/ a
782.1ns
```

5. "LURD" robot

### What Julians can learn from BQN

1. Broadcasting semantics, `Each ([¬®](https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/doc/map.html))`, and Taking Arrays Seriously‚Ñ¢.
2. Data parallelism techniques.
3. Bit vector optimizations.
4. Flattening data recursive structures for performance.
5. Array-ify all the things.
6. Algorithmic thinking

### Notes and words of caution

The syntax and symbols of BQN is a big "love it or hate it" part of the deal. I won't try to convince you to *like it*, but I have found it much easier to take a silly, mnemonic based approach to what each symbol does:
    * `` ‚â°"abc" `` will give you the "depth" of something, because it looks like a little ladder that you descend
    * `` ‚åà `` is taking the "highest" value (and is thus the max), ``‚åä`` is taking the "lowest"
    * `` +¬¥ `` will be dragging all the stuff to the right of the tick towards the `+`, so it's a reduction
    * `` +` `` If you use the tick the other way, you will be dragging the `+` *towards* the stuff on the right, so it's a `scan`, from left to right. 
  These are just the examples that come to mind, but I've found (completely subjectively) for BQN's symbology to be a bit friendlier/more consistent than APL's.
Be mindful that the `‚Äø` character to denote lists is not the same as that of arrays. The [docs say that](https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/doc/arrayrepr.html#brackets) newbies usually start out with these for easy manipulation examples and gradually move on to explicit array notation with the fancy brackets:

```bqn
    3 1‚ä∏+‚ä∏√ó 5
20
    3‚Äø1‚ä∏+‚ä∏√ó 5
‚ü® 40 30 ‚ü©
```

As stated in the page, [general array notation is a thorny problem](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Array_notation) in APL, and it took Julia about 10 years to finally nail down the tools [and syntax to land it in Base.](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/33697).

- Reading BQN/APL is likely where the learning difficulty curve hits hardest when starting out - this [docs page](https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/doc/context.html#is-grammatical-context-really-a-problem) was very useful to grok that `Àú` is a 1-modifier (as all symbols that "float higher up") and `‚àò` (like all symbols with unbroken circles) are 2-modifiers. Concretely, having a `context free grammar` removes ambiguity
- When I'm struggling to find out how to write my solutions to problems like the `Increasing Array`, this is my workflow:
  1. Start with thinking "I should propagate the max function" like `` ‚åà`a ``. I'll press `Shift+Enter` on the online BQN REPL and build up the solution
  2. "I should now try to subtract it from the original array" and write `` a-‚åà`a ``
  3. "Ah, right - I need to add a flip thingy" and evaluate `` a-Àú‚åà`a ``
  4. "Sweet, just have to reduce with a sum now" `` +¬¥a-Àú‚åà`a ``
  5. "Ok, to make it tacit I had to use those ‚ä£ ‚ä¢ thingies." (I go and review the [modifiers diagrams docs](https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/doc/primitive.html#modifiers))
  6. (After much plugging away at the REPL) ... "Dammit, I forgot I can use the `Explain` button!"
  7. (Fiddle around some more) "OK, I think I got it" and write

```bqn
Sol ‚Üê +¬¥‚àò(‚åà`-‚ä¢)
```

- The next big step up in BQN skills is [identifying function trains](https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/doc/train.html), which took me a bit of spelunking about in the manual before finding it. For example, going from the first line to the second in this snippet üëáüèª

```bqn
"whatsin" {(ùï®‚àäùï©)/ùï®} "intersect"
"whatsin" (‚àä/‚ä£) "intersect"
```

proficiently will really up your game in code-golfing powers, should you be interested in that. This [APL Wiki page](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Tacit_programming#Trains) and the [Trainspotting](https://xpqz.github.io/learnapl/tacit.html) links and [videos at the end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enlh5qwwDuY?t=440) are also useful resources.


### Useful idioms

At some point, any seasoned array programmer develops a good collection of known code snippets. Here's a few to save you some headaches:

- Reading lines from a file can be done via:

```bqn
lines ‚Üê ‚Ä¢FLines "day01-a-test.txt"
nums ‚Üê ‚Ä¢BQN¬® lines
```

The `‚Ä¢BQN¬®` isn't optimal, but it's good enough to get going with AdventOfCode problems.

- Benchmarking! (I am a Julia REPL stan after all.) If you're in the REPL, you can use `)t:X`

```bqn
)t:1000 3+3
14.666 ns
```

This will run your code `X` times and tell you how long it took on average. Elsewhere, `‚Ä¢_timed` can be bound to the left argument
How does one get a finer performance report though?
`Dzaima` kindly posted:

> [perf report](https://tinyurl.com/467pyk8n) of that, with some comments - most of the time is in replicate (which is implemented with pdep & pext, i.e. SWAR; 8 bytes per iteration), followed by the ‚â†-scan, which is more SWAR, but it processes 64 items per iteration so it's fast

To get that, you do

```bash
sudo perf record rlwrap ./BQN
```

type in your script and then

```bash
sudo perf report
```

- `TODO` Generating random arrays:
If we need to repeat a string 100 times, we can use:
```
100‚•ä"<div>Hello <b>CppNorth!</b></div>"
```
That will give you the above string repeated 100 times.


### Interesting resources

For those that *truly* want to stare into the abyss and have it stare right back at them, there's some ~university level courses that are written in APL/BQN/J.

- [Code Report/Connor Hoekstra's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UogkQ67d0nY&t=780s) Youtube channel - where he goes over some of the [history and theory of combinator logic](https://archive.org/details/combinatorylogic0002curr) via code examples in Scala, Haskell and APL.
- [Here's Kenneth Iverson's](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-41422-0_2) `Notation and Thinking` paper.
- [Physics in APL2](http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/apl/Books/Physics%20in%20APL2)
- [Calculus in J](https://www.jsoftware.com/books/pdf/calculus.pdf)

### What's next?

...Well, I think I want to learn a bit from the people that *took parallelism and performance seriously in ML* aka, "What if Haskell wasn't slow and they wanted to dunk on MATLAB"?

Don't forget...
