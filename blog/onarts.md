### Intro
When I tell people I study physics, more frequently than not I've had to help avoid a panic attack or two.
There's always that 2nd grade teacher, the trauma, the gnashing of teeth; I don't really fault
people for having gone through the pedagogic wringer and suffered the tyranny of schooling.
This is the story I tell math-phobic to let them know I think they're right.

As usual, by [sponsoring me on GitHub, I can continue my open source campaign](https://github.com/sponsors/miguelraz/). 
Plus, you get a monthly summary of all my writing shenanigans at the end of the month.

### Art class

Let's imagine an ideal art classroom for beginners in secondary school. The recess bell rings
and the kids are streaming in to their seats. In front of every kid there's a full decked-out
art kit: brushes, paints, canvas and the works. Being their first art assignment, the kids
will fill out one of those paint-by-number Monalisa's -- there's chunks of the painting
numbered `1` and they should all be green, all the `2` sections should be red, and so forth.

Everyone'
