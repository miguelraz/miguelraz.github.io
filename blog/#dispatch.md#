# Hello, World! :wave: I'm Dispatch

My name's **Dispatch**,  your friendly neighbourhood walkie-talkie, and I'm here to talk to you all about Julia -  a cool programming language and why I think it's just so neat.

#### Reading time: 20 minutes
#### Summary:
This post is about Julia and *multiple dispatch* as its foundation.
Julia is not
- the first language to implement multiple dispatch
- the only language to use multiple dispatch

But it definitely feels like the first to stick the landing. The **audience** of this post are programmers who like Python/R/C++/Rust
who have heard of Julia but don't get what new things it brings to the table.

My **claim** is this: Julia is unique in implementing multiple dispatch as a fundamental design feature
around which to build an entire language.
Yes, there's a fancy subtyping algorithm that Jeff Bezanson (Julia co-creator) pulled out of Turing-knows-where
and that Swift is re-engineering with some unholy [term rewriting](https://fullstackfeed.com/formalizing-swift-generics-as-a-term-rewriting-system/) shenanigans,
but that's not all the "new contribution" - careful design iteration around multiple dispatch with measured trade-offs is.

The rest of this post are code snippets in other PLs and how they look like next to a Julian re-implementation.

To talk about all these things, we'll be hearing from our newest battery-powered friend, **Dispatch**

\dispatch{Hey peeps, that's me!}

... interspersed with a few comments of our not-quite-yet-super-proficient-but-keeps-working-at-it-student, **miguelito**

\miguelito{¡Hola Dispatch! Nice to meet you!}

Off we go!

How about some Julia code here?

```julia
f(x) = x^2
```
