* Quick Julia Intro â€” For Julia novices, this lesson introduces the numerical libraries (DifferentialEquations.jl and Plots.jl), Julia variables, and slicing arrays.
* Step 1 â€” Linear convection with a step-function initial condition (IC) and appropriate boundary conditions (BCs).
* Step 2 â€” With the same IC/BCs, nonlinear convection.
* CFL Condition â€” Exploring numerical stability and the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition.
* Step 3 â€” With the same IC/BCs, diffusion only.
* Step 4 â€” Burgersâ€™ equation, with a saw-tooth IC and periodic BCs (with an introduction to Sympy).
* Intermission: Array Operations with Julia
* Step 5 â€” Linear convection in 2D with a square-function IC and appropriate BCs.
* Step 6 â€” With the same IC/BCs, nonlinear convection in 2D.
* Step 7 â€” With the same IC/BCs, diffusion in 2D.
* Step 8 â€” Burgersâ€™ equation in 2D
* Intermission: Defining Functions in Julia
* Step 9 â€” Laplace equation with zero IC and both Neumann and Dirichlet BCs.
* Step 10 â€” Poisson equation in 2D.
* Step 11 â€” Solves the Navier-Stokes equation for 2D cavity flow.
* Step 12 â€” Solves the Navier-Stokes equation for 2D channel flow.
