# I'm trying to get a GSoC 2024 in LLVM

and I will be documenting my work with this ongoing blogpost in reverse chronological order.

Lost the renaming battle to standard practices. Can't complain. Updated the PR to reflect that.

Now, reading the [DCE](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/release/17.x/llvm/lib/Transforms/Scalar/DCE.cpp) pass code.

Ok, Andrzej Warzyński did [an incredibly useful tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ar7cJl2aBuU) for `llvm-tutor`.

I'll try writing the Transformation pass, since it's closes to what I need.

Notes:
    * `LLVM_DEBUG` is super useful. 
    ```
#include "llvm/ADT/Statistic.h"
#include "llvm/Support/Debug.h"

#define DEBUG_TYPE "mba-add"
STATISIC(SubstCount, "The # of substituted instructions"
    ```
    and then you can do:
    ```
    LLVM_DEBUG(dbgs() << *BinOp << " -> " << *NewInst << "\n";
    // or , with Statistic and `-stat` on the `opt` CLI and debug build
    ++SubstCount;
    ```

* Analysis inherits from `AnalysisInfoMixin`

* Very common pattern:
```
for (auto &Func : M) {
    for (auto &BB : Func) {
        for (auto &Ins : BB) {
            ...
```

* You call `PreservedAnalysis.abandon()` when you wanna bail on a logic.

* `FileCheck` is a pattern matching tool that comes with LLVM. Can check emitted assembly output for test correctness.

* Rely on CMake's `find_package` and add sanity-checks to your scripts!

* LLDB is your friend 
```
lldb -- $LLVM_DIR/bin/opt -load-pass-plugin lib/libMyPass.so -passes=my-pass -S dummy.ll
(lldb) b MyPass::run 
(lldb) r
```

Finally: started a branch called `scmp-and-ucmp` and I'll start trying out changes there whilst people make up their minds.

Jyn strikes again and sometimes you can just do `make` after `cmake` because some stuff is optional.

Otherwise, install:

```
sudo apt install libzstd-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libedit-dev
```
to get rolling.

Once you do 
```
# Run the pass
$LLVM_DIR/bin/opt -load-pass-plugin ./libHelloWorld.{so|dylib} -passes=hello-world -disable-output input_for_hello.ll
# Expected output
(llvm-tutor) Hello from: foo
(llvm-tutor)   number of arguments: 1
(llvm-tutor) Hello from: bar
(llvm-tutor)   number of arguments: 2
(llvm-tutor) Hello from: fez
(llvm-tutor)   number of arguments: 3
(llvm-tutor) Hello from: main
(llvm-tutor)   number of arguments: 2
```
using `-disable-output` means no bitcode gets produced.

Passes come in 3 flavors, mostly: Analysis, Transformations and CFG manipulations.

Note that `clang` adds the `optnone` function attribute if 1) no opt level is specified or 
`-O0` is specified. 

Ah, forgot to run the `cmake .. -> mold -run make -j` and had some passes missing. Derp.

Minutes lost to cmake bullshit: 60.

Oh sweet! I just learned that I can write an injection pass that will give me a new binary and it will print out cool analysis info.

Also, if I get an instrumented binary I can just use `lli` to interpret the `.ll` file directly.

You can also build a static binary that will run that analysis for you! 

Ran a bunch of passes with `opt` and friends. Transformation passes will normally inherit from `PassInfoMixin`.

Analysis Passes will inherit from `AnalysisInfoMixin`.

Ok, cool I an outdated example in llvm-tutor [in the examples](https://github.com/banach-space/llvm-tutor/pull/111) and sent a PR for it.

Tomorrow I shall dive into those optimization passes at the end and hopefully run some good `lit` tests.


## 7/02/2024 

Alright, did some good catchup on the semester and pushed the [PR forward a bit](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-add-3-way-comparison-intrinsics/76685/7?u=miguelraz).

I also had an awesome "uniwtting tourist" genius moment by pointing out the return type could be different than what Nikita had thought of.

Today I setup my environment with

```
wget -O - https://apt.llvm.org/llvm-snapshot.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-add-repository "deb http://apt.llvm.org/jammy/ llvm-toolchain-jammy-17 main"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y llvm-17 llvm-17-dev llvm-17-tools clang-17
```

so now I can run `opt` shenanigans without awkward path invocations.

## 2/02/2024 

I'm waiting for others to chime in on my latest fix so I will be reading on how to add [unit tests](https://llvm.org/docs/TestingGuide.html).

Cool, that took like 25 minutes and I pushed a commit into the unit test generation framework.

Took me a bit but tried adding using `llvm-lit` and couldn't get the `Examples` folder to run,
so I posted a question in the #beginners channel about it.

## 1/02/2024 

Sweet! I was able to address Nikita's refactoring comments without too much hassle.

I guess the next task is to add it to the Verifier.

-> I read the `llvm/lib/IR/Verifier.cpp` header and grep'd for `smin`. Seems I can add a 

```
Intrinsics::vector_reduce_sthreecmp:
Intrinsics::vector_reduce_uthreecmp:
```

on line 5378 and get away with this. I don't see other places where it's defined.

I think I've hit my potential here. I will go do some tutorials.

### "hazlo cobarde"

Add the [3 way comparison instruction](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/llvm-add-3-way-comparison-intrinsics/76807/10) `<=>` to LLVM. 

I like this GSoC in particular because

* I will learn a wide swath of LLVM 
* I'll be working with a lot of optimization passes
* I'll get to bring cool perf to C++/Rust and Julia
* I was dared by [the other, more talented Miguel](https://twitter.com/DrawsMiguel/status/1759708211286835309) to actually help improve LLVM

### Task 1: Add to LangRef

[Add a new intrinsic](https://llvm.org/docs/ExtendingLLVM.html) - `Langref`, then `Intrinsics.td`, then maybe the pass verifier.

I've already put up a [sample PR](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/83227) and got redirected on what looks like the proper working path for this endeavour.

Oh neat, I've finished. Only took about 1 hour with careful copy pasting. I'm probably blundering the return type being `iM` bits, but someone will correct me.

Now, I need to add an entry of the intrinsic into TableGen.

### Task 2: Add to Intrinsics.td

Whelp, I guess I gotta learn tablegen and then this `Intrinsics.td` file.

Ok, I found [a non-intimidating TableGen overview](https://llvm.org/docs/TableGen/index.html).

Gotta find the optimization wizardry in there after reading for a few minutes.

Alright, took more than a bit of an hour but [I got pushed something for this task](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/83227#issuecomment-1972375003).

Pinged Nikita to get some adults to look at my horrible TableGen incantation.

See ya tomorrow.
