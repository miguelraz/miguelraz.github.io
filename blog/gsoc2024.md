# I'm trying to get a GSoC 2024 in LLVM

and I will be documenting my work with this ongoing blogpost in reverse chronological order.

### "hazlo cobarde"

Add the [3 way comparison instruction](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/llvm-add-3-way-comparison-intrinsics/76807/10) `<=>` to LLVM. 

I like this GSoC in particular because

* I will learn a wide swath of LLVM 
* I'll be working with a lot of optimization passes
* I'll get to bring cool perf to C++/Rust and Julia
* I was dared by [the other, more talented Miguel](https://twitter.com/DrawsMiguel/status/1759708211286835309) to actually help improve LLVM

### Task 1: Add to LangRef

[Add a new intrinsic](https://llvm.org/docs/ExtendingLLVM.html) - `Langref`, then `Intrinsics.td`, then maybe the pass verifier.

I've already put up a [sample PR](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/83227) and got redirected on what looks like the proper working path for this endeavour.

Oh neat, I've finished. Only took about 1 hour with careful copy pasting. I'm probably blundering the return type being `iM` bits, but someone will correct me.

Now, I need to add an entry of the intrinsic into TableGen.

### Task 2: Add to Intrinsics.td

Whelp, I guess I gotta learn tablegen and then this `Intrinsics.td` file.

Ok, I found [a non-intimidating TableGen overview](https://llvm.org/docs/TableGen/index.html).

Gotta find the optimization wizardry in there after reading for a few minutes.

Alright, took more than a bit of an hour but [I got pushed something for this task](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/83227#issuecomment-1972375003).

Pinged Nikita to get some adults to look at my horrible TableGen incantation.

See ya tomorrow.
