# I'm trying to get a GSoC 2024 in LLVM

and I will be documenting my work with this ongoing blogpost in reverse chronological order.

### "hazlo cobarde"

Add the [3 way comparison instruction](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/llvm-add-3-way-comparison-intrinsics/76807/10) `<=>` to LLVM. 

I like this GSoC in particular because

* I will learn a wide swath of LLVM 
* I'll be working with a lot of optimization passes
* I'll get to bring cool perf to C++/Rust and Julia
* I was dared by [the other, more talented Miguel](https://twitter.com/DrawsMiguel/status/1759708211286835309) to actually help improve LLVM

### Next task

[Add a new intrinsic](https://llvm.org/docs/ExtendingLLVM.html) - `Langref`, then `Intrinsics.td`, then maybe the pass verifier.

I've already put up a [sample PR](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/83227) and got redirected on what looks like the proper working path for this endeavour.
