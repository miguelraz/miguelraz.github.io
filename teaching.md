### Anki Decks

[Anki](ankiweb.net/ankiweb.net/) is a free software that optimizes memorization. Incredibly useful to speedup language learning. I also pair it with [mdanki](https://github.com/ashlinchak/mdanki) to generate study cards on the fly for topics I need help learning. 
- [BQN Glyphs](https://github.com/miguelraz/miguelraz.github.io/tree/master/blog/ankis/bqn-glyphs.apkg) - [BQN is an array programming](https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/) that builds off the learnings of APL and is FOSS. They're cool peeps, but memorizing the glyphs is a bit tough. This Anki deck and the [BQN Crate quiz](https://mlochbaum.github.io/bqncrate/) are a great combo to get up to speed quickly.
