My name is Miguel Raz Guzm√°n Macedo, and I am an undergraduate physics student at UNAM interested in HPC, Julia, numerical relativity, and open source science. I also enjoy cooking, handstands, and volunteering at debating competitions, and making educational programming [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC840v4b_71e78fmPHiCPQVg) and [streams](twitch.tv/BrainRPG).

You can contact via [twitter](https://twitter.com/miguelraz_), [github](https://github.com/miguelraz), or shoot me an email with miguelraz*/@/*gmail.com.
