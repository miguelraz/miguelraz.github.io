# Hola! :wave:

\tableofcontents <!-- you can use \toc as well -->

My name is Miguel Raz Guzmán Macedo, and I am an undergraduate physics student at UNAM, México.

If something has to do with **Julia** 🐱‍💻, **numerical relativity** 🌌, **HPC** 🤖 or **open source science** 🦾, I'm interested.

 I also enjoy cooking, handstands, volunteering at debating competitions, and making educational programming [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC840v4b_71e78fmPHiCPQVg) and [streams](https://www.twitch.tv/BrainRPG).

You can contact via me [twitter](https://twitter.com/miguelraz_), [github](https://github.com/miguelraz), or shoot me an email with miguelraz*/@/*gmail.com.
