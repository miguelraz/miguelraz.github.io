# Hola! :wave:

\tableofcontents <!-- you can use \toc as well -->

My name is Miguel Raz Guzm√°n Macedo, and I am an undergraduate physics student at UNAM. 

If something has to do with Julia, numerical relativity, HPC or open source science, I'm interested :muscle:

 I also enjoy cooking, handstands, and volunteering at debating competitions, and making educational programming [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC840v4b_71e78fmPHiCPQVg) and [streams](https://www.twitch.tv/BrainRPG).

You can contact via me [twitter](https://twitter.com/miguelraz_), [github](https://github.com/miguelraz), or shoot me an email with miguelraz*/@/*gmail.com.
