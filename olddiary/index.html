Only if you count &#43; projection it wouldn&#39;t be hard to implement the mass matrix stuff in the Rosenbrock methods though so that would be a DAE solver &#43; callback interface but no IDA, dassl, and daskr do not implement the callback interface Sundials and DASKR have a hard problem with garbage control: they need a custom allocator so that way Julia&#39;s GC can know their size. To me, it&#39;s easier just to implement native Julia DAE solvers than to handle that... Dassl.jl just needs love. but I&#39;m thinking of starting over, extending OrdinaryDiffEq.jl in that direction, instead of working on DASSL.jl so... that&#39;s where I am at with that I would need a good reason to push there though, since I don&#39;t generally use DAEs in my research, which makes it hard to justify the work Drayton Munster @dwmunster May 01 12:58 extending OrdinaryDiffEq.jl in that direction In the direction of implementing native Julia solvers? Christopher Rackauckas @ChrisRackauckas May 01 12:58 multistep methods OrdinaryDiffEq.jl is all one-step methods right now, but it already is setup to do multistep methods, but I haven&#39;t done those yet I think it&#39;s probably just better to recreate the multistep methods anyways: the old Gear methods &#40;LSODE/Sundials/DASKR etc., they are all actually the same code&#41; are super convoluted and really need to just be restarted from scratch it&#39;s all time management though: since Sundials exists I put that off for other things it wouldn&#39;t be hard to setup the passing of the mass matrix to radau though, and that&#39;s a very good DAE method, but that doesn&#39;t have callbacks yeah, Rosenbrock is your best bet right now I&#39;m releasing my next roadmap in about a week, after Google Summer of Code is announced and DiffEq 2.0 is out but essentially, my next focus is on tools for PDEs, symplectic methods, higher order SDE methods, and stiff ODEs DAEs written in mass matrix format come for free out of the stiff ODE stuff, at least in many cases. Christopher Rackauckas @ChrisRackauckas May 01 13:03 Then I believe 4.0 would be the big push for a new multistep NDF/BDF/Adams implementation but honestly, those are slightly overrated: they&#39;re only useful if the function evaluation is very expensive and you don&#39;t have many events &#40;they have to restart from Euler, so tons of events will slow them down even in the case where they do best. Unless it&#39;s a huge PDE discretization, it&#39;s kind of a toss-up between these and implicit RK methods like Radau&#41; I&#39;ll have a blog post explain this all, but really it was 1.0 &#61; core &#40;good common interface to ODE/SDE/DAEs with basic event handling&#41; 2.0 &#61; infrustructure &#40;all of the bells and whistles: find out how to resize, completely bonkers event handling, abstract types, split problems, interpolations, APIs, solution handling, etc.&#41; 3.0 &#61; PDEs &#40;toolboxes for making PDEs easy, and some standard discretizations&#41; 4.0 &#61; algorithms &#40;now implementing algorithms is easy, and so just do it the standard way and everything else like event handling is free&#41; robindenhardteriksson @robindenhardteriksson May 02 09:29 @ChrisRackauckas I saw that you were interested in integrating some global sensitivity analysis into Diffeqs. I was going to move over some matlab stuff I had previously done for this into Julia. What&#39;s the best place to discuss this? Christopher Rackauckas @ChrisRackauckas May 02 09:30 right here robindenhardteriksson @robindenhardteriksson May 02 09:32 Perfect. What is the advantage you see in having this in DiffEqs rather than another package? Christopher Rackauckas @ChrisRackauckas May 02 09:33 not much. But if it&#39;s in JuliaDiffEq, then the members of JuliaDiffEq could help with the maitanance. But this could be built outside of DiffEq without a problem robindenhardteriksson @robindenhardteriksson May 02 09:35 I was just thinking about the numerical advantages. With local sens, you&#39;ve already got access to jacobians if you&#39;re implementing this in DiffEqs. But from the global sens methods I know, none of that kind of info is required Christopher Rackauckas @ChrisRackauckas May 02 09:36 if you implement it on the DiffEq interface, than any underlying numerical method can be used I think the ability to swap between BDF methods and high order RK methods to match the problem is where the gains would be had robindenhardteriksson @robindenhardteriksson May 02 09:38 Ah, you mean depending on the resolution you&#39;re looking for with your global sens? ie. if a parameter only has a small effect you could switch methods to better resolve this effect Christopher Rackauckas @ChrisRackauckas May 02 09:39 yes and things like that and also you could estimate models with events robindenhardteriksson @robindenhardteriksson May 02 09:39 models with events? Christopher Rackauckas @ChrisRackauckas May 02 09:40 yes like special behavior on zero-crossings like a bouncing ball discontinuities robindenhardteriksson @robindenhardteriksson May 02 09:40 right Christopher Rackauckas @ChrisRackauckas May 02 09:40 the DiffEq interface also makes the extension to stochasticity easy I&#39;m not sure what the other option would really be anyways. What else would you build it on top of? robindenhardteriksson @robindenhardteriksson May 02 10:10 The quick-and-dirty GSA i had done was pretty much by itself. You would have to write a sensitivity function, which would compute outputs from inputs from the GSA, this is where you would solve models. You would define an input space, then it would do some sampling and return different sensitivity indices Christopher Rackauckas @ChrisRackauckas May 02 10:13 but what you were sampling was solutions of a diffeq solver with different parameters? robindenhardteriksson @robindenhardteriksson May 02 10:13 mostly yes Christopher Rackauckas @ChrisRackauckas May 02 10:14 yeah I was just thinking of making it so that way it can take some diffeq problem and some diffeq algorithm, and use that internally for the sampling if you have an idea for making this encompass more general models, that works too robindenhardteriksson @robindenhardteriksson May 02 10:16 It would be a nice addition to have it integrated, right alongside the local SA Were you thinking of implementing it in a similar way to the current local SA? Christopher Rackauckas @ChrisRackauckas May 02 10:17 no local SA is a much different algorithm in implementation that builds an extended diffeq and solves that I don&#39;t think you need to do any modifications like that for global SA. As you said, you can just sample solutions at different parameters. robindenhardteriksson @robindenhardteriksson May 02 10:19 right, I didn&#39;t really ask what I meant to. I know the algorithms work differently, I was thinking of more abstractedly, in terms of receiving an ODEProblem or ParametrizedFunction and then working on that to return sensitivity indices. Christopher Rackauckas @ChrisRackauckas May 02 10:19 yes that&#39;s the plan robindenhardteriksson @robindenhardteriksson May 02 10:20 I thought I&#39;d read up on the current local SA to get an idea how the global would be done Christopher Rackauckas @ChrisRackauckas May 02 10:20 I&#39;m not sure that would actually be too helpful global SA is actually closer to parameter estimation I think in how it&#39;s all based on sampling solutions most of what&#39;s done for local SA would likely be unnecessary for global SA robindenhardteriksson @robindenhardteriksson May 02 10:21 Okay. Translating and writing the algorithms I&#39;m fine with, as a user it&#39;s just the internals of DiffEq which I&#39;m not familiar with Christopher Rackauckas @ChrisRackauckas May 02 10:21 I don&#39;t think you need to use the internals at all. At a high level, if I remember the Morris algorithm correctly its:</p> <ol> <li><p>Take a set of parameters and solve the diffeq</p> <li><p>Change the set of parameters around according to some algorithm, solve again</p> <li><p>Repeat 1 and 2, saving data along the way.</p> </ol> <p>robindenhardteriksson @robindenhardteriksson May 02 10:23 You think it&#39;s as simple as receiving an ODEProblem, solving it with a bunch of sampled parameters and returning sensitivity indices? beat me to it Christopher Rackauckas @ChrisRackauckas May 02 10:24 I will say I haven&#39;t implemented it yet so I am not intimitely familiar with all of the details but that&#39;s what it seemed like it was from a first read. robindenhardteriksson @robindenhardteriksson May 02 10:25 Yeah, that&#39;s basically it, sampling parameters and re-calculating a model output based on new samples Christopher Rackauckas @ChrisRackauckas May 02 10:27 so yeah, I&#39;m not sure any of the diffeq internals are really needed. It should be standard diffeq usage &#40;solve diffeq and change parameters&#41;, then turned into a library function to make it easy for others to use it. robindenhardteriksson @robindenhardteriksson May 02 10:29 Is there an example I can base myself on, or a set of principles for making it a library function? Christopher Rackauckas @ChrisRackauckas May 02 10:31 The main principle is that it should try to be as efficient as possible, yet agnostic to the type of problem it&#39;s solving &#40;ODE/SDE/DDE/DAE/etc.&#41; and the algorithms it&#39;s using to solve it &#40;it should be able to swap out OrdinaryDiffEq methods for Sundials methods etc. as much as possible&#41; but I think it&#39;s usually best to just start small make a method which only works for ODEs, and then generalize later I prefer multiple consecutive PRs, each adding one detail, to one giant PR that is supposed to solve the whole problem. &#40;of course, you don&#39;t have to go all the way. You could write it to ODEs and PR that and be off on your merry way. Then that gives me or someone else a starting point to work from later&#41; robindenhardteriksson @robindenhardteriksson May 02 10:37 Okay. In any case, I&#39;m going to be implementing several GSA methods into Julia for my own use &#40;ODEs for now, possibly stochastic later&#41;. I&#39;d be more than happy to help out and possibly contribute. From which repo should I branch and then submit PRs? Christopher Rackauckas @ChrisRackauckas May 02 10:38 DiffEqSensitivity.jl you&#39;ll see it&#39;s a very tiny library, just with the local SA stuff it&#39;s in dire need of love üòÑ robindenhardteriksson @robindenhardteriksson May 02 10:39 yeah, I saw the code isn&#39;t very long. Does that actually contain everything to do local SA? Christopher Rackauckas @ChrisRackauckas May 02 10:40 yeah robindenhardteriksson @robindenhardteriksson May 02 10:41 that&#39;s some nice and concise code there Christopher Rackauckas @ChrisRackauckas May 02 10:42 I mean, local SA is just appending to the diffeq some extra states for solving the SA equations simultaniously it&#39;s not an adjoint method or anything fancy &#40;though I do wish to get there&#41; robindenhardteriksson @robindenhardteriksson May 02 10:48 true, not overly complex, but still nice Well thanks for the time to chat.

PlotRecipes, on the other hand, is fragile. That is because the very purpose of PlotRecipes is to hold those plotting recipes that require dependencies on other packages, exactly to separate those dependencies from the rest of the ecosystem. This means that PlotRecipes fails every time one of the dependencies fail - in this case both bugs in PlotRecipes come through NetworkLayouts. But that doesn&#39;t affect the rest of the functionality of the Plots ecosystem. The most solid approach is for downstream packages to not rely on PlotRecipes but to depend on RecipesBase and put the plotting functionality inside the package that defines the types. That will clearly keep all bugs to the package itself. Maybe it&#39;s worth considering something like that for LightGraphs? The graph functionality in PlotRecipes itself is general and not restricted to LigthGraphs, so maybe even a small GraphRecipes package residing in the Graphs organization?</p> <ol start=102 > <li><p>Compatibility <a href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/Juleps/issues/3">is hard.

BVPs too some codes here and there do versions of tha tas well Sundials and thus SciPy does ODEs and DAEs, then they have a separate wrapper for BVPs R wraps essentially the same codes as SciPy none of these really handle SDEs Christopher Rackauckas @ChrisRackauckas 12:55 and the specialized extra packages that do handle SDEs are not well maintained and don&#39;t implement many algorithms so definitely including random equations &#40;RODEs, SDEs&#41; is unique. Then tying this all to PDEs Of course, we wrap all of the same algorithms the other suites do, but we don&#39;t use them as the core. We use them as bait in benchmarks And I think that&#39;s essentially the summary Christopher Rackauckas @ChrisRackauckas 12:56 If you look at some extended diffeq feature in another language say parameter estimation you can pull up how to do it in Python http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11278836/fitting-data-to-system-of-odes-using-python-via-scipy-numpy http://adventuresinpython.blogspot.com/2012/08/fitting-differential-equation-system-to.html but if you want to do it in Julia, we have a built in function that does exactly what the top searches are doing http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/latest/analysis/parameter<em>estimation.html#lm</em>fit-1 but recommend you don&#39;t use it because it&#39;s a really bad method, and instead point you to more advanced methods Seeing things like that &#40;everyone re-implementing Levenburg-Marquedt parameter estimation for each new project, instead of developing a suite of well-tested more advanced methods&#41; pisses me off so much that I had to do it.</p> <ol start=98 > <li><p>MCMC and DiffEq</p> </ol> <blockquote> </blockquote> <p>@jamesonquinn they&#39;re actually very different DiffEq usually isn&#39;t about data it&#39;s about models is simulating trajectories of a class of nonlinear models which just happen to describe scientific phenomena really well. So to a statistician, you can think of DiffEq as just an entire library of scientifically interesting nonlinear models Parameter estimation of differential equation is the question: what about the model needs to be true in order to fit data? One example of this in statistics &#40;under different words&#41; is nonlinear mixed effects models. But generally, it&#39;s defining some optimization problem to solve, and finding out the parameters for the model &#40;friction coefficients, chemical reaction rates, etc.&#41; such that the timewise trajectories you get out of the simulations match the realistic data. These converge when you start to talk about these methods since some of the most common methods for finding parameters are Bayesian methods and MCMC but at that point, you&#39;re almost away from diffeqs, essentially making the assumption &quot;okay we can simulate diffeq models, and using the results of simulations vs data ...&quot; but actually, the vast majority of DiffEq is methods for simulating the diffeqs Christopher Rackauckas @ChrisRackauckas 18:22 And that&#39;s why I am interested in your work: I want MCMC tools to apply at the end of the stack here</p> <h3 id=03052017 ><a href="#03052017" class=header-anchor >03/05/2017</a></h3> <ol start=94 > <li><p>Found a super handy guide for <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/amath/sites/default/files/attached-files/introduction_to_finite_differences_3.pdf">finite difference methods as a review</a></p> <li><p>Read the Fornberg - Calculating weights in finite differences formulas paper.

And if you check the coefficient of the highest order error term, its really bad so it&#39;s essentially just a series of bad RK methods. however, if your necessary tolerance is really low, then a higher order RK method will always do better but the definition of &quot;low&quot; seems to be really low like, 5th order does well until like 1e-5, then something like 8th order does well until you need sub 1e-16 accuracy, 14th order still beats extrapolation even at accuracies like 1e-40</p> <blockquote> <p>a recent result by Gyongy is a BS technique for parabolic SPDEs</p> </blockquote> <p>which shows that higher order methods can achieve arbitrary accuracy &#40;easy way to prove that&#41; but it still doesn&#39;t break the Kloeden computational barrier. &#40;accuracy vs computational cost metric in SPDEs&#41;</p> <blockquote> <p>Random Differential Equations - wait for Kloeden&#39;s book.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>‚Ä¢ Davie &amp; Gaines &#40;2000&#41; showed that any numerical scheme applied to the SPDE</p> </blockquote> <p>&#40;6&#41; with f &#61; 0 which uses only values of the noise Wt cannot converge faster than the rate of 1/6 with respect to the computational cost</p> <blockquote> <p>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314242937<em>Random</em>Ordinary<em>Differential</em>Equations<em>and</em>their<em>Numerical</em>Solution</p> </blockquote> <p>you can find the thesis if you look hard enough it&#39;s online it has a bunch of methods for higher order RODEs and I&#39;ll get around to implementing it Oh, I stored the reference in the issue discussing RODEs in diffeq JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl#145 http://publikationen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/frontdoor/index/index/docId/40146</p> <blockquote> <p>if you want the most modern &quot;book&quot; on the subject, this is it: http://www.math.uni-luebeck.de/mitarbeiter/roessler/publikationen-e.php</p> </blockquote> <p>http://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/09076636X that being the main article I think or this review: http://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/research/papers/prst/prst2010-02.pdf with the latest development of course being http://chrisrackauckas.com/assets/Papers/ChrisRackauckas-AdaptiveSRK.pdf</p> <blockquote> <p>the field diverged a bit</p> </blockquote> <p>essentially because it is really hard to beat Euler&#39;s method and so mathematicians still study it a little bit but pushed forward to new equations like RODEs and SPDEs where some semblance of &quot;better than Euler&quot; is just coming out while the more applied communities went to solving discrete stochastic &#40;Gillespie&#41; methods ftp://www.cs.toronto.edu/na/reports/NA.Bio.Kin.Survey.rev1.pdf &#40;pst&#33; If anyone wants to join in with implementing these algorithms...
